For today I assigned you Healy's chapter 8

- It is a super useful resource for polishing your visualizations in R 

- Lots of great examples in this chapter that will hopefully inspire you to make cool things

<br>

R is an incredibly deep visualization tool and the deeper you go the more powerful it becomes.

<br>

**Any questions on the Healy chapter?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk about the assignment for Friday and then I'll let you get to work on the final paper submission

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Propose a "good" research question

2. Identify the second data project we'd use

3. Sell us on this proposal!

:::

::: notes

Friday we select the other data project we want to use to build our research project this semester

- Keep the "designing a good research question" material in mind and review the options on our data spreadsheet

- You must submit a proposed research question on Canvas before class

- MUST be connected to The World Press Freedom Index

- Your question can either be to explain press freedom OR to use press freedom to explain something else

<br>

**Questions?**

<br>

Alright, the rest of our time today is for you to finish up those final papers!

<br>

**Notes**

**What do we learn about the world from analyzing the Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders?**

1. The importance of the project in the real-world,
2. The key contributors of uncertainty in the project's data,
3. What we learn about the current world from analyzing the most recently available data, and
4. What we learn about the trajectory of press freedom in the world from analyzing the data across time
