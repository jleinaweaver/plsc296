Prep for Class

1.  Make sure report 1 highlights on these slides!

<br>

Welcome to R&R day!

- This is our chance to touch base on the first reports,

- To celebrate some of the great work you did in those reports, and

- To get to work on revising those reports

<br>

But first, a few bits of house-keeping!

## What is our research question? {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height=2}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Military\nPower\n(CoW NMC)", "Human rights\nand\nthe rule of law\n(FFP)")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.85, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

Last class we selected our second data project but didn't have time to specify our research question.

- So let's do that now.

<br>

Remember, per Huntington-Klein (2022) a research question must have two key elements:

1. It can be answered, and 

2. It improves our understanding of how the world works.

<br>

- *ON BOARD*: Give me options!

<br>

*My Brainstorming*: Military Power -> Human Rights/Rule of Law

- Do states that prioritize their military capabilities respect the human rights of their citizens?

- Do more powerful states tend to undermine the human rights of their citizens?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Thanks for the detour, now let's dig into the first report!

## Add an Overall Introduction {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}

::: notes
A compelling report needs an introduction paragraph before Section 1 begins.

- This is your chance to unify the entire paper, to show that it all connects together

<br>

I really like how Peyton's introduction here sets up the report and outlines the rest of the paper for the reader

## Captions should tell the whole story {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

::: notes
Taylor's caption here does a great job explaining what the measure being investigated aims to do.

- A reader skimming the figures now understands the big picture of this visualization

<br>

What this needs is to add a sentence of analysis!

```

::: notes
Sam does a great job adding analysis to his caption

<br>

What this needs might be just a little bit more of the intuition that Taylor provided!

<br>

In brief, each caption should give the title, explain the purpose of the plot and give some of the analysis. 

- Readers should be able to follow your analysis from reading the figures alone.

Peyton's titles on this figure are both compelling.

- Clever language choices can elevate simple descriptions to something more substantial

If you are making comparisons across visualizations (e.g. across time), then the viz need to be next to each other

<br>

Tryn, Clayton and Annabelle did a great job making it easy to compare the distributions across time!

## Arguments require evidence {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .smaller}

<br>

The FSI emphasizes its mission to keep fragile states from becoming failed states, which can have devastating consequences. Fragile states and failed states exhibit symptoms which include poor economic performance and violence that can transcend national borders and can create international dilemmas. As Di Jon (2009) notes, countries that lack structure, political order, law, and the ability to provide the essentials for their citizens qualify as a failed state. This creates a wide-ranging category for failed states that includes everything from Columbia, which struggles with cartel influence to countries such as Somalia which have experienced complete failure.

## Lead with analysis not statistics {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .smaller}

<br>

In analysis of the 2023 data, a majority of states are facing at least some notable issue in regards to their economy. There is a notable minority of states that seem to thrive within the economy indicator, however, this is not the “average” experience seen within states in this dataset. Within the economy indicator, the mean score was 5.69, suggesting that the average economy within the dataset has quite notable issues (Fragile States Index, 2023). In an attempt to better understand the spread, however, specific examples should be explored. Israel, Singapore, Denmark are all tied for the top spot, with a score of 1.0. This data shows that these three states have a strong GDP per capita, low unemployment, low poverty, etc. On the other hand, Yemen holds a score of 9.9, just 1/10 of a point shy of the maximum score (Fragile States Index, 2023). This is hardly surprising noting Yemen’s crippling poverty issue coupled with its decade-long civil war wreaking havoc on the state’s economy.

Maverick gives us a really nice example of leading with ideas and supporting those ideas with stats

Before you get to work on your revisions, two quick notes

## Healy Ch 8 "Refine your plots" {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png"}

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/07_2-Healy_Cover.jpg")
```
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
1. Use color to your advantage

2. Layer color and text together

3. Change the appearance of plots with themes

4. Use theme elements in a substantive way

Plus tons of examples in the case studies!
:::
::::

::: notes
First: For today I assigned you Healy's chapter 8

- It is a super useful resource for polishing your visualizations in R 

- Lots of great examples in this chapter that will hopefully inspire you to make cool things

<br>

R is an incredibly deep visualization tool and the deeper you go the more powerful it becomes.

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

<br>

**Let's build a presentation!**

1. Davis (2019) "10 Tips to Improve your Presentation Slides"

2. Naegle (2021) "Ten simple rules for effective presentation slides"


::: notes
Second: Friday I'd like us to build a presentation version of your reports

- I'm not a comms guy, but I've read a ton on visualizations

<br>

On Canvas I've placed web links to two articles that I think give us a set of basic principles we can draw from for our work.

<br>

Ok, the rest of today is yours to work on the R&R's.
