::: notes

Remember, ultimately your job as a scientist is fundamentally one focused on measurement

- The empirical world doesn't tell us anything on its own, we have to make observations

- Every observation carries uncertainty and our work is in trying to develop valid and reliable understandings of the empirical world

### Let's collect some important data!

::: notes

For class today, you each selected a variable and analyzed its methodology

- I would like each of you to briefly introduce us to your chosen variable and its strengths and weaknesses

- This way we all walk away from this step of the exercise with a broader and deeper understanding of the kinds of national level measures available from the World Bank

<br>

HOWEVER, I'd like us to do this in a data focused way!

- Everybody open today's project on Posit Cloud

<br>

**SLIDE**: The data piece of the project

:::



## Analyze Measures from the WDI {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

Use the View() function in RStudio to identify the **top five, middle five and bottom five countries** on your measure

- Record the countries AND their scores



## Presenting Measures from the WDI {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

What do we learn about the world using your selected measure?

- What are "good," "middle" and "bad" scores in the real world?

- Are the measures valid and reliable enough to say these scores are different? Why or why not? 

::: notes

Ok, let's do this.

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- *15 people x 3 mins = 45 mins*

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Let's answer a question!**

1. Propose a question, and

2. Propose an answer

:::

::: notes

Everybody take a look at the assignment for next class and let me know if you have any questions!

<br>

Your job is to:

1. Propose a question we could answer by evaluating the relationship between TWO of the variables we reviewed today

2. **WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE DATA**, propose an answer to your question. 

- Based on your intuitions / prior experience, what do you think the answer to this question is? Explain your reasoning!

<br>

Canvas DISCUSSION: Let's Answer a Question!

Reflect on all of the WDI variables we discussed in class on Wednesday and then:

1. Propose a question we could answer by evaluating the relationship between TWO of the variables, and
2. WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE DATA, propose an answer to your question. Based on your intuitions / prior experience, what do you think the answer to this question is? Explain your reasoning! (3+ sentences)

Note: Please do not submit a question that examines the same two variables proposed by someone else in class. Ideally we come up with 15 different questions to consider!
