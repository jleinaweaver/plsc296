**Any questions about the class from your review of the syllabus?**

<br>

- Attendance cliff

- Participation assignments

- Expectations around AI

- etc

<br>

Starting on Friday you'll need a laptop for the work of our class

- If you don't have a device you can bring please let me know ASAP 

- The Computer Science department has laptops we can check out during class so we should be able to accommodate you

<br>

**SLIDE**: Refreshing the big picture lessons of our first class

### Our **goal** as political scientists is to **generate knowledge** about the social world using the **scientific method**

::: notes

In our first class I set us up with this big picture goal in mind.

<br>

The scientific method is, broadly speaking, an approach that roots itself in generating knowledge from measuring the observable world

- Key to this is remembering that science is an approach to creating knowledge that can be applied to essentially any field of study

<br>

**Think about our "measuring class heights" exercise and tell me, what are the components of a "useful" scientific measurement?**  

- (**SLIDE**)

::: {.r-fit-text}

**To create useful measurements you must:**

1. Define the Concept

2. Specify the Tool

3. Specify the Process

4. Test for Robustness

:::

::: notes

We will be focusing on this key element of "doing science" over the first three weeks of our class.

- I cannot underestimate for you how important this component of science is.

- I do not care how fancy your data analysis becomes, it's all gibberish until you convince the reader you have a useful measure of your central concept.

<br>

**Any questions on these four broad steps to making useful measurements?**

<br>

For today I asked you to go find us news stories that use data as a central component of their arguments

- **SLIDE**: I'd like us to use these stories to explore a couple of questions

:::



## Exploring the Data in the News {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

- What did you find?

- How are they using data?

- Is the data high enough quality for their conclusions?

:::
::: notes

Seminar style: Let's talk about what you brought to class!

- *Let the excited lead the conversations and you encourage the class to explore the ideas/measurements in each*

- *Don't be afraid to pull stuff up on the screen*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Big picture takeaways

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

### Based on all these examples, what do we learn about the use of data in the media to report on current events?

- Do the authors explain and defend the quality of the measures?

- Do they make it possible for the reader to evaluate the quality of the measures?

::: notes

**Based on all these examples, what do we learn about the use of data in the media to report on current events?**

- **Generally speaking does the data in these examples improve the quality of the arguments? Why or why not?**

<br>

The bottom line is that too much of our news coverage treats "data" like a collection of incontrovertible facts

- This is a serious problem for us as consumers of the news

- We KNOW that measurements are uncertain and so we must be more careful in how we use "data" to make arguments

<br>

A big task for us in this class together is to deepen your skills in evaluating measurements

- These skills will make you a better consumer AND producer of information

- **SLIDE**: Our textbook will help with this

::: notes

This semester we're going to use the Pollock and Edwards book as our touchstone

- This book will give you a crash course in BOTH the intuitions and execution of doing social science research

<br>

My hope is that this serves as a valuable reference for you as researchers into the future

- It will definitely help you in Research Design and Senior Seminar

- But it will also help you in the real world beyond these walls

- Good information is vital to good decision-making and our media ecosystem is too full of bad information these days
