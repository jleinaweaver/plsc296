Everybody check your descriptive stats table and see if we match and then we'll talk through your answers to the questions

<br>

Discuss Each:

1. Which variables are missing too much data, or too much of the necessary data (selection bias), for us to claim that these descriptive statistics represent variation across the world?

    - Selection Bias: Did you check to see WHICH countries are missing data?

2. Which variable is the most positively skewed? What does that mean in real world terms?

    - Distributions with a longer, or skinnier, right-hand tail have a positive skew
    - The mean > median suggests a positive skew as outliers pull it that way

3. Which variable is the most negatively skewed? What does that mean in real world terms?

    - Distributions with a skinnier left-hand tail have a negative skew
    - The mean < median suggests a negative skew as outliers pull it that way

4. Which variable holds the most variation across the sample (e.g. countries most dispersed across its values)?

5. How substantively different is life in the bottom quartile countries (25th percentile) from those in the top quartile (75th percentile)?

<br>

**Ok, how are we doing with calculating and interpreting descriptive statistics?**

<br>

Well, either way, I'm confident our work this week is going to give all of you a better sense of these statistics!

- **SLIDE**: Our work this week shifts us to data visualization

:::::

::: notes
Today we practice making data visualizations working entirely by hand!

- I've brought paper and rulers!

<br>

Please don't aim for making art today.

- We're trying to learn the intuitions underpinning each type of visualization.

<br>

**REVEAL**: Why do this?

- Learning these intutions by hand will help drive home the lesson of connnecting variable types to visualization tools.

- Certain types of variables tie to specific tools

- e.g. Tables of categorical variables often look better as a bar plot

<br>

**REVEAL**: Being a programmer, e.g. writing code, is a means of solving problems in small steps.

- Drawing a visualization by hand works the same way

<br>

**REVEAL**: The better you learn how specific descriptive stats connect to specific viz, the sooner you will learn to "see" the visualization in a table of descriptive statistics.

## Univariate Analysis {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

**The "right" visualization depends on the variable type**

+ Nominal or Ordinal Variable: Bar Plot

+ Interval-level Variable: Box Plot or Histogram

+ Interval-level Variable across time: Line Plot

::: notes

Here is our plan of attack for today.

- We will first draw bar plots of categorical variables,

- Then histograms and box plots for numeric variables, and

- Finally, line plots of numeric variables that change across time.

<br>

**Everybody have this written down?**

::: notes

Bar plots, as the textbook explains, represent the number (or proportion) of observations in each level using the height of a bar.

<br>

Drawing a bar plot is super easy:

1. Count the levels in the variable (e.g. make a table),

2. Draw the x axis with labels for each level,

3. Draw the y-axis with enough height to represent the largest count

4. Draw each bar to represent the number of observations in that level

:::

::: notes

In the realm of numerical data there may not be any overlap in numbers in the data set!

- This means we get a table of almost all '1's 

    - e.g. the odds of two cities having exactly 18,409 people are pretty darn low.
    
- That's, arguably, less informative than just giving someone the actual data.

**Numerical Variable: Make a Histogram**
:::

<br>

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_1-Johnson-Histogram.png")
```

::: notes

In a bar plot for a categorical variable, each bar represents the count of each level.

<br>

To build a bar plot for numeric data we group numbers that are close together into each bar.

- In histograms we call these groupings "bins"

<br>

This example from a different textbook shows a histogram of women's ages.

- It looks like five bars per 15 years so I'm guessing the bins are each five years wide.

<br>

**Does that make sense?**

<br>

Let's practice building a histogram to see if that helps drive the intuition home for you.
:::

**Numerical Variable: Make a Histogram**

    - Bin 2: 11 - 20
    - Bin 3: 21 - 30
    - Bin 4: 31 - 40

2. Make a bar plot of these bins
:::

::: notes

1. Run the table function on the cty fuel economy variable

    - The add together the totals in each bin
    
2. THEN draw the bars for the new groups!

<br>

Everybody make us this histogram (e.g. a bar plot of bins)

:::
::::

::: notes

Using software you can easily adjust the size of the bins in order to find a version of the histogram that you feel best conveys the shape of the distribution.

- The five bins version is approx 5 mpg per bar

- The 25 bins version is slightly more than 1 mpg per bar

<br>

### Is everybody clear on how a histogram is like a bar plot applied to a numeric variable?

<br>

So, a histogram is a binned bar plot and it attempts to show us the shape of the distribution.

- BUT, as you see here, the size of the bins has a BIG effect on what the histogram looks like!

We'll find that the value of a box plot increases DRAMATICALLY when comparing multiple distributions
