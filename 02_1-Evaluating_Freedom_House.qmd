### Our **goal** as political scientists is to **generate knowledge** about the social world using the **scientific method**

::: {.incremental}
- Science is the process of testing ideas using empirical data

- Empirical data is generated by measuring the world

- All measurements include uncertainty

- Therefore, all knowledge is uncertain and needs to be improved!

*Read slide*

- **REVEAL x 4**

<br>

That's the job we've signed up for in this discipline

- In this class we develop our measurement skills in order to help us quantify the uncertainty AND work to make it smaller

- That means our skills from this semester directly translate into improving our knowledge

<br>

This week we'll develop and practice our measurement skills by exploring two data projects

- Next class we'll examine a Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) survey

- **SLIDE**: But today we begin with Freedom House data

**Had anybody heard of Freedom House before this?**

- **How have you encountered their work before? Have you?**

<br>

Their reports are frequently covered as huge news by the media and their researchers are often invoked as experts on democracy and dictatorship

<br>

For class today I asked each of you to dig into the methodology of the Freedom in the World report by Freedom House so we could talk about uncertainty and measurement

- HOWEVER, before we get into the weeds on this let's talk about the big conclusions of the 2025 report as presented by the researchers

- **SLIDE**

::: notes

Here we see the key findings from p1 of the report

<br>

**What stands out for you here?**

- **Big conclusions?**

<br>

**Who is the audience for these findings? Who are they talking to?**

<br>

**How much uncertainty do they acknowledge in the findings here?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk about the map

For class today I asked each of you to dig into the methodology of the Freedom in the World report by Freedom House

- BUT before we get into the weeds on this let's talk about what we see here

<br>

This is the map of the three level categorical variable produced by the researchers

- All countries are classified here as Free, Partly Free and Not Free

- **What do we notice from looking at the data





<br>

Before we get into the weeds on this, let's talk about the big picture conclusions of these researchers on p1 of the report





1. Discuss the big picture takeaways of the Freedom in the World 2025?
- NOTE: Key findings on p1 of the report depend almost completely on your evaluation of the measures
