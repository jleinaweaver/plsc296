### Our **goal** as political scientists is to **generate knowledge** about the social world using the **scientific method**

::: notes

*Read slide*

<br>

Remember!

- Science is the process of testing ideas using empirical data

- Empirical data is generated by measuring the world

- All measurements include uncertainty

- Therefore, all knowledge is uncertain and needs to be improved!

<br>

That's the job we've signed up for in this discipline

- In this class we develop our measurement skills in order to help us quantify the uncertainty AND work to make it smaller

- That means our skills from this semester directly translate into improving our knowledge

<br>

This week we'll develop and practice our measurement skills by exploring two data projects

- Next class we'll examine a Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) survey

- **SLIDE**: But today we begin with Freedom House data

:::

![](Images/02_1-Freedom_House_Website.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

**Ok, who is Freedom House and what do they do?**

- An advocacy organization plus a think tank producing research

- That "Donate" button is prominently placed at the top of every page on their website...

- Per the website: Freedom House is the oldest American organization devoted to the support and defense of democracy around the world. It was formally established in New York in 1941 to promote American involvement in World War II and the fight against fascism. 

<br>

**How have you encountered Freedom House's work in your classes?**

- **How has it been used?**

<br>

My impression is that their reports are frequently covered as huge news by the media

- Let's see if I'm mistaken

- Everybody open up a news site (e.g. BBC, WSJ, NYTimes, etc) and search for Freedom House

- **How often do they appear as evidence, a source or a contributor to the news stories there?**

- *REPORT BACK*

<br>

Ok, so the world press seems to take them seriously!

- Our work for today is to do a quick, but critical dive into what they produce in order to see if they should be taken seriously on these topics!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Before we talk measurement, let's just highlight the current state of the world according to Freedom House

:::

![](Images/02_1-FH_Key_Findings2025.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Here we see the key findings from p1 of the report

<br>

**Setting aside any methodological concerns you might have, what stands out for you here?**

- **What are the big conclusions they want you to accept?**

<br>

**Based on how this is written, who is the audience for these findings?**

- **In other words, who are they talking to?**

<br>

**How much uncertainty do they acknowledge in the findings here?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Now let's talk about the map

:::



## Freedom in the World 2025 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/FreedomHouse_Map_2025.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}


::: notes

The current FIW report includes a link to this map on the website

- The map visualizes the distribution of their main variable

- A three level categorical variable that classifies all countries as either Free, Partly Free or Not Free

<br>

**Again, setting aside any methodological concerns you might have, tell me about the world according to this map**

- **What does Freedom House want us to accept?**

<br>

Alright, so FH is widely used and draws conclusions about the world with very little uncertainty being acknowledged

- Our job today is to evaluate if these conclusions can be supported by the measures being designed and employed

- **SLIDE**

![](Images/02_1-FH_Methods.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

For class today I asked each of you to dig into the methodology of the Freedom in the World report by Freedom House

- My hope is that this has given you a jump start on thinking critically about what FH does well and what might be problematic

<br>

*Split big BOARD in half: Political Rights with two columns under it for Strengths and Weaknesses; Civil Liberties with same*

<br>

For Canvas today everyone has submitted strengths and weaknesses for each of these measures.

- Everybody grab a marker and add your submitted strengths and weaknesses to the board! 

- Don't worry if someone else overlaps with yours, add yours!

- Go!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's dig in

![](Images/02_1-FH_Scoring_Process.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Starting with the Political Rights measure

- **What are the key STRENGTHS of the Political Rights measures in terms of validity and reliability?**

- **What are the key WEAKNESSES of the Political Rights measures in terms of validity and reliability?**

- **Bottom line, based on these strengths and weaknesses, how confident should we be in the precision of a countries score from 0-40 on this scale?**

    - **Put differently, how big a move in this score would you require in order to believe something has changed in that country?**

<br>

Let's switch to Civil Liberties and repeat the exercise

- **What are the key STRENGTHS of the Civil Liberties measures in terms of validity and reliability?**

- **What are the key WEAKNESSES of the Civil Liberties measures in terms of validity and reliability?**

- **Bottom line, based on these strengths and weaknesses, how confident should we be in the precision of a countries score from 0-60 on this scale?**

    - **Put differently, how big a move in this score would you require in order to believe something has changed in that country?**
    
<br>

**SLIDE**: But that's not the end of FH's work!

::: notes

The FH team THEN uses the PR and CL scores in order to categorize all countries in their three-level classification

- **What are the strengths of this approach?**

- **And what are the weaknesses?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Take all of this work back to the conclusions of the report

**Are these measures designed and implemented by Freedom House valid and reliable enough to support each of these conclusions? Why or why not?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: To end today I want us to dive into the data itself!

## Posit Cloud for Data Analysis {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Sign up for a free account (link on Canvas)

2. Accept the invitation to join the class space (link on Canvas)

3. Open Posit.cloud in your browser

4. Open our shared workspace: "PLSC 296: Data Analysis (Spring 2026)

5. Open our project for today: "Week 2 (Jan 21) Freedom House Data"

::: notes

Everybody should have completed the first two steps BEFORE class today!

<br>

This semester we will be learning to use R to do data analysis

- As a front-end, we'll be using RStudio which is an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, to make using R easier

- During Week 4 of class we will set aside time on the Monday to help everyone install the software on their own laptops

- In the meantime we'll use this cloud version as a means to warm into the work

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, but what do I mean by R vs RStudio?

:::




## R is the statistics engine {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/03_3-R_Engine.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Key analogy: R is the engine and RStudio is the fancy dashboard we use to drive the car

- When you open RStudio, you are opening R!

- RStudio just makes it much, much easier to work with R to get things done.

<br>

You can absolutely do everything in R without RStudio.

- You cannot use RStudio without having R.

<br>

So, this semester you are learning to code in R but we'll be working in RStudio.

- **Make sense?**

<br>

Posit Cloud is handy as a starting point because it bundles both together with nothing to install!

- Plus I can easily load data and packages into it for our use together bfore you've learned how to do that stuff

<br>

**SLIDE**: What you should be looking at now

:::



## Posit Cloud {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/02_1-Posit_Cloud.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Bottom-left corner here is R itself in a console window

- This is the engine where the stuff you make gets processed

<br>

Top-left is your notes file where you write your analyses

- THIS means your scientific analyses are saved as a simple text file forever!

- Any code you write here are transparent and your analyses are replicatable!

- Plus, anytime in future you need to do a thing you've done in the past you can simply copy the code from your notes into the new project!

<br>

Top-right lists all of the data you've loaded

<br>

Bottom-right has windows for: 

- file structure,

- The visualizations you make, and

- The help files

<br>

Ok, let's switch to live coding!

- Show them running code with "run" button and "ctrl + enter"

- Load the packages, load the data, view data 
    
- **Scroll through the data, sort using the column headers and discuss: Any interesting observations?**

<br>

Have them run the simple descriptive stats for the political rights score (PR_rating)

- **What do we learn from these analyses?**

<br>

Have them copy and paste code to redo all analyses for CL_rating

- **What do we learn from these analyses?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Assignment for next class

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Evaluating the Measurement in a Research Survey**

1. Read the Fowler (2014) chapters on survey design

2. Evaluate the TRIP Snap Poll on Canvas

:::

::: notes

**Any questions on the material today or the assignment?**

<br>


Canvas Assignment: Evaluating the Measurement in a Research Survey

The Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) Project is a research lab at William & Mary’s Global Research Institute (GRI) who issues regular “snap polls” as international events unfold in order to provide policymakers and the public with real-time information on the views of international relations (IR) experts.

Using the ideas in the Pollock and Edwards chapter and the Fowler (2014) reading I want you to evaluate the measurements in the TRIP Snap Poll 22 Report (question wording, answer options, question ordering, etc).

1. Identify at least THREE reasons this poll produced valid and reliable data
2. Identify at least THREE reasons the data produced by this poll may not be valid and reliable
