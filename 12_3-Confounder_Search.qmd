Prep for Class

1. Review identification DAG submissions

2. Send out data links:
    - WDI: [LINK](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)
    - Class spreadsheet: [LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLZjrK1QCzzX7W8TIUduyIdcCXSpPP-2r9DxI7VqQwk/edit#gid=0)

::: {.r-fit-text}

Submit a DAG for our research project

- Press Freedom &#8594; Environmental Quality

*ON BOARD*

Let's get all three proposed DAGs on the board.

- Everybody add their proposed confounders as a list under each DAG

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

Let's narrow this down!

- For ease of our final reports, let's aim for one confounder for each DAG (or two max)

::: notes

Data search time!

- Let's see if we can find good options on the WDI database

- If not there then we can consult the class data spreadsheet

<br>

I will merge the confounders onto our data files and we'll start working with multivariate analyses on Monday.

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

**Perform a Univariate Analysis of our Selected Confounder**

- Use all of the tools in your UNIVARIATE toolbox (descriptive statistics and visualization) to analyze each confounder on its own

- In other words, summarize and describe the variation in each confounder
