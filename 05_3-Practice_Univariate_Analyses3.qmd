**How did we do making these visualizations?**

<br>

**Which approach, in this case, is a better choice for supporting an argument about global change over time?**

<br>

I'm hopeful everyone is convinced that the most compelling answer to each question requires:
1. Complete sentence explanations of your answers, 

2. Evidence in visualizations, AND 

3. Evidence in descriptive statistics

<br>

ALSO, the utility of an animation depends on the clarity of the trend over time!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Alright, let's analyze some new data!
:::



## {background-image="Images/05_2-Freedom_House1.png" .center}

::: notes

Today we practice our univariate analysis tools by examining some of the data produced by Freedom House.

### In very broad strokes, what is the purpose of the measures produced by Freedom House? What are they trying to measure?

<br>

Freedom House's "Freedom in the World" project is an attempt to quantify "freedom" in countries across the world in terms of "political rights" and "civil liberties"

<br>

### According to Freedom House, what is the difference between "political rights" and "civil liberties"?

- Political Rights in three subcategories:
    1. Electoral Process (3 questions), 
    2. Political Pluralism and Participation (4), and
    3. Functioning of Government (3).
    
- Civil liberties in four subcategories:
    1. Freedom of Expression and Belief (4 questions),
    2. Associational and Organizational Rights (3), 
    3. Rule of Law (4), and 
    4. Personal Autonomy and Individual Rights (4).)

<br>

If we had chosen Freedom House as our data set we would need to spend quite a bit of time digging into these conceptual labels.

- How distinct are they? 

- Are these valid definitions? Are they reliable?

<br>

Our focus today is to practice our univariate analyses so we'll set methodology aside for the moment.

```
:::
::::

::: notes

A big problem for us in interpreting these counts is that the number of countries being studied increased DRAMATICALLY between the two ends of our dataset

- 1972 obs: `r nrow(fh1972)`

- 2023 obs: `r nrow(fh2023)`

- +`r round((nrow(fh2023)/nrow(fh1972)-1)*100, 1)`%

<br>

Key lesson: IF the sample changes across time, then counts and proportions are very dangerous to interpret!

- We really can't tell from this if states are becoming more free or if new states are more likely to be free

<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

Let's try some alternative analyses to see if we can unpack what is happening here.

- To start, everybody make me a bar plot of the number of countries in each year in the full dataset

- We're going to treat `year` as a categorical variable

- So, our aim is to count countries in each year

<br>

(**SLIDE**)
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618}
# Observations counted across time
ggplot(fh, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar()
```

::: notes
**What do we learn from this about the world and about Freedom House?**

- (Spike in 1991 as USSR collapses so maybe some new countries were more free?)

- (Not as sure about that spike in 2023)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Now, we can also take this one step further by tracking the count of each type of country in this plot.
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618}
# Counts of one variable across time
ggplot(fh, aes(x = year, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar()
```

::: notes

Kind of cool, right?

- Think of this like what you've been doing all semester to "fill" in the bars with color

- This tells R to "fill" in the bars with a different variable!

<br>

### Did everybody make this?

<br>

One problem here is that the levels in our status variable are not in a logical order

- Should probably go NF, PF to F on top

- **SLIDE**
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618}
# Create a new variable using factor()
fh$status_f <- factor(fh$status, levels = c("F", "PF", "NF"))

ggplot(fh, aes(x = year, fill = status_f)) +
  geom_bar()
```

::: notes

*Talk them through creating a new variable*

- Don't overwrite your variables, make new ones!

- The levels represents the order you want

- This order looks backwards because the bar plot builds up from the bottom

<br>

### Everybody get this?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Before we analyze, let's fix the colors
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618}
# Add colors
ggplot(fh, aes(x = year, fill = status_f)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "pink", "red3"))
```

::: notes

This function draws on the R Color Brewer which is a package full of built in color palettes

- You should explore the options on this as it can do a ton!

- Three types available: "seq" (sequential), "div" (diverging) or "qual" (qualitative)

- A big number of different color palettes

- And I've used "direction" here to reverse the order of the colors so red is not free.

<br>

### What do we learn from this about the world and about Freedom House?

<br>

**SLIDE**: One more tweak possible here...
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618}
# Convert the counts to proportions
ggplot(fh, aes(x = year, fill = status_f)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "pink", "red3")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())
```

::: notes

Position = 'fill' asks the bar plot to convert itself into proportions on the y axis

- Think of this like using prop.table()

<br>

### How does this change our conclusions?

<br>

### Why is this SUPER risky?

- Completely hides the change in the number of countries per year

- Assumes changes in % are the same when there are 149 countries vs 210...

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's look at one more option for analyzing change across time before we practice
:::



## Exercise 2 {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
How are political rights changing across time?
:::

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
Visualize `pr` across time for the United States only
:::

::: notes

A second option for tracking change across time is to focus on a single observation

<br>

- Filter the dataset to only include the US

- geom_line()
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618, fig.width=7}
fh_US <- filter(fh, fh_country == "United States")

ggplot(fh_US, aes(x = year, y = pr)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1,7), breaks = 1:7) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Political Rights (1-7)", 
       caption = "Source: Freedom House (2024)", 
       title = "Political Rights in the United States have been remarkably stable over time")
```

::: notes

A fairly stable story over time, right?

- Something weird happened in 2016...

<br>

Everybody try this again but find us a country with tons of yearly variation!

<br>

### Report back, what countries are basket cases per this measure?
:::



## Practice Exercises {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

1. Are countries getting richer over time? Make a stacked bar plot of `wb_income` across time

2. Track the `gdp_per_capita` across time for the country you found with big variation in FH Political Rights

::: notes

Let's practice applying today's tools using the WDI data we've been exploring all week.

- Make and polish me two plots!
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.7, fig.width=7}
data1$wb_income_f <- factor(data1$wb_income, 
                            levels = c(NA, "High", "Upper-middle", 
                                       "Lower-middle", "Low"))

ggplot(data1, aes(x = year, fill = wb_income_f)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("deepskyblue4", "deepskyblue1", 
                               "pink", "red3"))
```

::: notes

An alternative to brewer for color palettes is viridis.

- Viridis is designed to be friendly to the color blind

- They don't always look as good, but let's not forget we should be inclusive in our visualizations!
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center .smaller}

```{r, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618, fig.width=9}
# Identify biggest Std Devs in FH 'pr'
# fh |>
#   group_by(fh_country) |>
#   summarize(sd = sd(pr)) |>
#   arrange(desc(sd))

# Plot GDP pc for top 10
data1 |>
  filter(country %in% c("Mongolia", "Bulgaria", "Ghana", "Romania", "Benin", "Chile", "Cabo Verde", "Poland", "Panama", "Mali")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdp_per_capita, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(scale = 1/1000, suffix = "k")) +
  labs(x = "", y = "GDP per capita (current USD)", title = "Tracking wealth for the states with the least stable political rights in the world") +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 3)
```

::: notes

As a programming process I first calculated the SD for each state across time

- Big Std Dev = big changes year to year in political rights for that country

<br>

Then I filtered the WDI database for the ten states with the biggest SD in FH

- Made a line plot for those ten and colored the lines

<br>

Super fascinating divide here between:

- Mostly African countries where rights are unstable and growth is non-existent, and

- European / C. American countries with erratice rights BUT economic growth!
