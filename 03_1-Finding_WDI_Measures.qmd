Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Make sure to record class variable selection and to build the dataset we will need for next two classes

<br>

**SLIDE**: In this first section of the class we have been laying the foundations for scientific data analysis

:::



## Section 1: Aims {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}
- Our goal as political scientists is to [**generate knowledge**]{style="color:blue;"} about the social world using the scientific method

- The [**scientific method**]{style="color:blue;"} is an exercise in measuring the empirical world in transparent and replicatable ways

- [**Measuring the empirical**]{style="color:blue;"} world in useful ways is REALLY hard

1. Conceptual definition

2. Operational definition 

3. Data collection

::: notes

In our first week of class we introduced the basic concepts we use to talk about measurement

<br>

**REVEAL**: Your first step is to produce a conceptual definition

- e.g. "clearly describes the concept's measurable properties and specifies the unit of analysis"

- Chapter 1 of our book gave us a nice template for creating conceptual definitions

- The concept of X is defined as the extent to which Y exhibit the characteristic of Z

<br>

**REVEAL**: Your second step is to convert your conceptual definition into an operational definition

- Some books refer to this as operationalization or instrumentalization

- In either case, the job is to describe the instrument you will use to measure the concept

- This could be numbers on a ruler, a 0 to 100 feeling thermometer or a Likert scale set of ordinal categories

<br>

**REVEAL**: Technically this is beyond the treatment presented in the first chapter of the textbook, however, this is also a very important step in measuring the empirical world

- Last week we examined two data projects that gave us examples of collecting data from expert survey panels

- This week we will examine a VERY different data collection process

<br>

**Any questions on this process?**

<br>

::: notes

That leads to the conceptual tools we use for evaluating a measure

<br>

By validity we mean how closely the measure comes to the intended concept (without unintended characteristics)

- The textbook introduced us to face validity and construct validity as two ways to evaluate the validity of a measurement

<br>

By reliability we mean how reliable a measure is. 

- Assuming no change in the property being measured, a reliable measure is one that gives the same result each time it is applied to the same case

<br>
    
While both are important qualities, validity tends to be the ball game for us

- If you're not measuring the actual concept you aimed for then the data isn't creating knowledge for us
    
<br>

Importantly, each of the measurement steps on the previous slide introduce their own complications in terms of validity and reliability

- A weak or idiosyncratic conceptual definition will almost certainly weaken your validity

- A poorly constructed operational definition will almost certainly hurt both your validity and reliability!

<br>

**Any questions on validity and reliability?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our work for this week

## The World Bank WDI Database {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

### Let's answer some important global questions!

::: notes

For today, I asked each of you to pitch us on three variables from the World Bank's database that you think sound interesting.

- The goal for this week is to narrow down our list, analyze validity and reliability and then finally to use this data to propose and answer questions!

<br>

Ok, everybody open up the discussion board for today

<br>

Our job is to help each person narrow down their list of three options to the ONE we will carry forward into our work Wednesday and Friday

- In a moment we'll go around the room, each of you can briefly walk us through why you picked these three options and then we'll have a quick discussion about which variable to focus on moving forward

- **Any questions on this?**

- Let's go!

- *IMPORTANT REMINDER: No one can select measles immunizations (%), birth rate, death rate or GDP per capita because we will explore them in Section 2 of the class*

<br>

**SLIDE**: With our variables selected I want each of you to get started on the assignment for next class

## For Next Class{background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Evaluate the Methodology of one Variable from the WDI**

1. Big picture discussion of the variable, and

2. Fine grained discussion (evaluating validity and reliability)

:::

::: notes

Everybody take a look at the assignment for next class on Canvas

<br>

The assignment for next class has two broad aims

- First is a series of questions to help keep the importance and clarity of the variable front and center

- Second is your evaluation of the measure itself

<br>

Evaluating the measure will require you to do some digging beyond the World Bank website!

- You should go directly to the source(s) that developed the measure AND to identify the processes they used to create it. 

<br>

**Questions on any of our material today or the assignment for next class?**

- Let's get to work so we can help each other if we get stuck!

- Go!

<br>

Canvas DISCUSSION: Evaluate the Methodology of one Variable from the WDI

Evaluate the validity and reliability of your selected WDI measure. This exercise asks you to investigate both the source(s) that developed the measure AND the process they used to create it. 

1. What is the variable you selected / were assigned?
2. Why is measuring this concept important? (e.g. real world impact)
3. Who produces this measure and how do they do it?
4. What are AT LEAST THREE reasons this measure is valid and reliable?
5. What are AT LEAST THREE reasons this measure may not be valid and reliable?
