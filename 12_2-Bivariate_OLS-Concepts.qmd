Prep for Class

1. Check Canvas submissions AND plug in guesses into code below

2. Update presidential results (if needed)

<br>

Today we move from our general intuitions of summarizing a relationship with a line to the more nuts and bolts of OLS regression

<br>

**IMPORTANT**: I cannot emphasize this enough, none of this works unless you keep up with the assigned readings

- My slides today CANNOT be your introduction to OLS if you hope to develop these skills

- At worst, today's class work should be your THIRD journey into OLS counting the Wheelan reading, the reading for today and our work in class on Monday

<br>

If you do the work, I promise that each time you go through the material it will make more sense.

For today I challenged each of you to draw us a line of best fit using only a ruler.

- **How did that go?**

<br>

NOTE that my RSS values may differ slightly from yours.

- You used a ruler, and I used R

<br>

Some of the class had trouble calculating the RSS.

- **Is everybody clear on summing the squared errors?**

In a sense, what we are doing here is mimicking the logic of a maximum likelihood approach.

- Taken to the extreme, we could fit a HUGE number of lines and simply keep the one with the least squared error

::: notes

Using some simple math I can tell you this is the line of best fit for this data.

- **So, how did you do? How close did you get with eye-balling it?**

<br>

This line is a HUGE improvement over the three we tried in class on Monday

- RSS dropped from 6.75 to 6 to 4.5 and now all the way down to 2.7!

- The residuals are all similar in size and distributed above and below the line

- **Does all of that make sense?**

<br>

Let's use the line to make some predictions

- **What is the change in Y predicted by our model for EACH change in X?**

    - (0.5)

- **What is the predicted value of Y if X equals five?**

    - (3.9)

<br>

Ok, so, why go to all this trouble of fitting and evaluating a line in order to summarize the relationship between two variables?

- **SLIDE**: Let's answer that question with data!

::: notes

As you well know, the diamonds dataset includes details on 53k+ diamonds in terms of their characteristics and estimated prices

<br>

From our bivariate analyses last week we discovered that:

- Bigger diamonds are typically more expensive, and

- There is a strong linear correlation between the two variables

<br>

While these two conclusions are useful, they are also quite limited in a practical sense

<br>

FIRST, in this plot I'm only showing you ten percent of the data so it doesn't get overwhelming
    
- e.g. 5 thousand observations

- A summary method that requires hiding 90% of the observations isn't a great tool for us

<br>

SECOND, we can't use these tools to easily answer specific questions

- **SLIDE**: For example...

**How much more should we expect to pay in order to move from a 1.5 carat to a 2.5 carat diamond?**

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.asp=.7, fig.width = 6, cache=FALSE}
range1 <- range(diamonds$price[diamonds$carat == 1.5])
range2 <- range(diamonds$price[diamonds$carat == 2.5])

diamonds |>
  slice_sample(prop = .1) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .05) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Carats", y = "Price") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,4)) +
  annotate("segment", x = 1.5, xend = 1.5, y = range1[1], yend = range1[2], color = "blue", arrow = arrow(angle = 90, length = unit(0.1, "inches"), ends = "both")) +
  annotate("segment", x = 2.5, xend = 2.5, y = range2[1], yend = range2[2], color = "blue", arrow = arrow(angle = 90, length = unit(0.1, "inches"), ends = "both"))
```

::: notes

Now that we have access to real diamond prices for 53k examples, it MUST be possible to answer simple questions like this.

<br>

**How could we use descriptive statistics to answer this question?**

- (**SLIDE**: Results)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**How much more should we expect to pay in order to move from a 1.5 carat to a 2.5 carat diamond?**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Make subsets
diamonds1_5 <- filter(diamonds, carat == 1.5)
diamonds2_5 <- filter(diamonds, carat == 2.5)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Summarize
summary(diamonds1_5$price)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(diamonds2_5$price)
```

::: notes

*Step through approach on slide*

<br>

**Ok, based on these results what is our answer to the question?**

<br>

**Is this a good answer? Why or why not?**

- e.g. Specific? Easily understandable?

<br>

The FIRST big problem with trying to answer our question with descriptive stats is that our choice of comparison is somewhat arbitrary

- There isn't really a robust way to defend our choice of which parts to compare

- e.g. compare means, medians, IQRs?

<br>

In this case comparing the means and medians shows an increase in price with weight, but comparing the maximums doesn't

- Is one of these more "true" or "correct" than the others?

<br>

**How could we use a visualization to answer this question?**

**Ok, based on these results what is our answer to the question?**

<br>

**Is this a good answer? Why or why not?**

- e.g. Specific? Easily understandable?

<br>

This still doesn't solve the arbitrariness problem

- These boxes are definitely different, but by how much?

<br>

IN ADDITION, these approaches don't give us an easy way to describe our uncertainty in the comparisons

- In other words, how confident should we be in these estimates of the mean or median?

- Are these groups comparable to each other?

<br>

**SLIDE**: And the sample size problem is a BIG one

::: notes

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Count the observations
nrow(diamonds1_5)

nrow(diamonds2_5)
```

<br>

Here I am scaling the width of the boxes by the size of each group

- The 1.5 carat group is only 793 diamonds out of 53k (e.g. 1% of the sample)

- The 2.5 carat group is only 17 dimaonds!!!

- We probably shouldn't be confident drawing conclusions about the relationship between diamond weight and value using 1% of the sample!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Regression can help us with all three issues!

::: notes

Regression analysis addresses all of these problems by producing a single line that is influenced by EVERY data point and represents the relationship of interest

<br>

This simple line summarizes all of that data and let's us answer any question with specificity

- On average, every one unit increase in diamond size is associated with an increase in the price of $7.8k

- On average, a 1.5 carat diamond should sell for approximately $`r round(predict(res1, newdata = data.frame(carat=1.5)), 2)`

- On average, a 2.5 carat diamond should sell for approximately $`r round(predict(res1, newdata = data.frame(carat=2.5)), 2)`

<br>

**Is everybody clear on how regression analysis can be a really useful summary of a relationship between two variables?**

<br>

**Per the readings, how does OLS find this line of best fit?**

- (**SLIDE**: the same way you did!)

OLS finds the line that minimizes the squared residuals of ALL THE POINTS.

- The name is in the acronym: ordinary least squares

- In essence, this attempts to draw a line through the "middle" of the relationship

<br>

In a sense, OLS is a procedure for finding the mean of Y for different levels of X

- That means you can think of the OLS line like representing the averages for the relationship

<br>

**Is everybody clear on this?**

<br>

So, why should we prefer a summary line that approximates the mean?

::: notes

Asking about "regression to the mean" means exploring the work of the 19th century statistician, Sir Francis Galton.

<br>

The results of a famous 1886 experiment

- Gathers the heights of 930 children and their parents

- The horizontal line here is the average height of the sample and the y-axis labels on the right show the differences to the average

<br>

The x-axis is organized by the heights of the parents

- So, the shortest parents are on the left of the line marked "A" and the tallest build to the right

- The children of those parents are plotted on the C line

<br>

Galton observed that:

- Parents shorter than average had children taller than them but also still shorter than average

- Parents taller than average had children shorter than them, but still taller than average

<br>

Galton explained this finding as "regression to the mean"

- **Can everybody see this in the plot?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Why does height show this regression to the mean?

::: notes

Qualities like your height are actually the result of adding together a bunch of different factors ([Link1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1570677X09000793), [Link2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64883-8))

<br>

Scientists estimate as much as 80% of height is genetic, HOWEVER

- Height is considered a polygenic trait, meaning many genes, each with a small effect, contribute to overall height rather than a single gene controlling it.

- That also leaves as much as 20% of the variation explained by environmental factors

<br>

Extreme values of height, being MUCH taller than average or shorter, require all of these different factors to point the exact same way

- The odds are that your kids will share many, if not most, of your same factors but a few will likely be different just by chance

- Those few differences pull their height away from yours

*Idea taken from McElreath book*

<br>

Imagine we line up 100 people on the 50 yard line of a football field

- Each person gets a fair coin

- We will ask each person to flip the coin

    - Heads take one step to the right (+1)

    - Tails take one step to the left (-1)

<br>

On the left I have a picture of our hypothetical field and all 100 subjects

On the right I have a bar plot showing where on the field each person is now

<br>

### Questions on the set-up here?

<br>

Let's collect some guesses about the outcome of this experiment

<br>

**After 10 flips of the coin, how many of our 100 subjects will still be on the 50 yard line?**

There are only eight possible outcomes from flipping a fair coin 3 times

- In six of these eight outcomes the flipper is only 1 step away from the starting point! (75%)

The results will always be different given the random coin flips, but after ten flips we tend to see:

- 25-30% of cases on the 50 yard line

- 55% within 2 steps!

<br>

The key observation: When you add a bunch of small differences together there are more ways for them to stay near the average than near one of the extremes.

- The output of most complex systems in the natural world are more likely to produce values close to the "normal" than at the extremes.

THIS is what Galton found with his research into parent-child heights.

- The mix of factors that explain why someone is very tall or very short (e.g. the extreme values) are less likely than those that reproduce the average

- HENCE, tall parents more likely to have kids shorter than them

- HENCE, short parents more likely to have kids taller than them

<br>

Across tons of different processes in nature we typically see extreme observations followed by less extreme observations

- THIS is the power of regression.

- When trying to represent a relationship regression uses the logic of the mean to summarize the relationship

On the right I'm showing you a regression table

- This should be incredibly familiar to you if you've read any quantitative academic literature

- This is the standard way that regressions are communicated in academic journals

- THIS is how I will expect you to report regression results in reports for this class!

- The readings and the R regression handout on Canvas can help you do this

<br>

So, regression is an incredibly powerful tool for data analysis.

- It can be used to provide summaries, answer specific questions and to make predictions for the future

<br>

However, as we learned form our hands-on work Monday, just because you can draw a line through the data, DOESN'T mean it's a good summary!

- When you include a regression in a report for this class I am REQUIRING you to evaluate it using four steps

Your first job is to examine the regression for missing data problems

<br>

The OLS procedure will estimate the line based ONLY on the observations in your dataset that have values for both variables

- SO, if one country has data for X and not Y, or vice-versa, it will be excluded automatically

<br>

R will give you the number of observations in the regression line, BUT you will have to check the actual dataset to see what it should be

- Here we see our diamonds regression includes all of the possible data

<br>

**IFF your regression is being fit on less than ALL the data in your sample it's up to you to make an argument that the missing data isn't a serious problem for your analyses**

<br>

**Questions on evaluation Step 1?**

<br>

*Notes*

- Social-desirability bias: The tendency of survey respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others.

- Non-response bias: Trump voters have simply been less likely to participate in phone polls than Democratic voters in the last few cycles.

- Language Barriers: How do you word a survey question so it will have the same meaning across different languages? Across different cultures?

- Lack of infrastructure: I'm guessing South Sudan lacks the infrastructure needed to develop high quality GDP figures

- Inaccessibility: Studies examining things like the effects of poverty, war or gender discrimination often cannot get reliable data from those places where these lived experiences are hardest.

- Governmental Interference: If I have to hear one more idiotic report of "polling data" from Russia showing Putin's sky-high approval ratings I will lose it.

Statistical significance aka does the coefficient have a '*'?

- Here we see that in this model the beta coefficient on diamond size clearly meets the test of statistical significance.

## What is Statistical Significance? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/11_1-Diamonds_2.jpg")
```

<br>

H<sub>0</sub> = Diamond size has no impact on price

::: notes
Conventional statistical significance testing is based on the idea of a null hypothesis.

<br>

In essence, we can frame our model as a competition between two hypotheses.

- The alternative hypothesis is what we suspect is true, that larger diamonds are associated with higher prices.

<br>

For every alternative hypothesis we can also describe the null hypothesis as the absence of that effect.

- e.g. Diamond size is not associated with price.

<br>

**SLIDE**: We can do this with any hypothesis.

H<sub>0</sub> = Education has no impact on voter turnout


::: notes
Some research has proposed that increasing levels of education may increase the likelihood of voting.

- AND, conventional hypothesis testing requires us to specify a null hypothesis

<br>

Let's be honest, this is probably the biggest weakness of testing hypotheses for "statistical significance"

- The assumption of ZERO relationship between two amorphous social dynamics is almost certainly not likely

Here you can see I've visualized the two hypotheses for us.

### Why is the null hypothesis a horizontal line? What does that mean?
- (For any level of diamond size, the model makes the same price prediction)
    - In this case, the sample average of prices.
    
<br>

### Is everybody clear on how we draw these two different lines?

<br>

We can also see from these plots the staggering difference in the errors attached to each line

- The regression line has a residual error of 129 billion

- The null line has 6 times the error in its line!

<br>

As we did last class, we prefer a line that minimizes the error

- THIS is the significance test!

::: notes

The significance test, as represented by the p-value, essentially tells us if the data better matches the red or the blue line.

<br>

To be completely technical, the p-value is a kind of weird test

- ASSUMING the null hypothesis is true, how likely are you to get a value as extreme as the slope of the blue line?

<br>

Lots of problems with this, not least of which is, the null hypothesis is never likely to be true in the real-world.

- Even if the relationship is small, assuming ZERO relationship is an extreme position to take.

<br>

Here I'm fitting an OLS model to only 10% of the diamonds data.

- **Can everybody see why the regression cannot differentiate between the null and the alternative hypotheses?**

<br>

**Questions on this basic intro to statistical significance?**

<br>

Ultimately, statistical significance is one piece of evidence, among many, that implies your model "fits" the data better than the null argument.

- None of these are the end-all, be-all, you need all of them!

<br>

Our Takeaway: Your second job is to check the significance of the coefficients

- A model with significant coefficients is preferred because it fits the data better than the null.

::: notes

Here I am showing you four relationships between a hypothetical X and Y variable

- Each relationship represents a different level of correlation

- Remember that the correlation is a number between -1 and 1 that represents the strength of the linear association between two variables

- So, the top left has very little positive correlation and the bottom right has almost perfect positive correlation.

- **With me?**

<br>

In our simple OLS terms, the R-squared is the square of the correlation coefficient

- The R-squared tells you what proportion of the outcome can be explained by the predictor

- This runs from 0 (e.g. explains none of the variation) to 1 (e.g. explains all of the variation)

<br>

So, the top left shows basically no correlation and an R2 value of essentially zero which means this line does not explain much of the outcome at all

<br>

The top right shows that a fairly strong positive correlation (0.51) translates to a line that only explains 24% of the outcome

<br>

The takeaway is that, all things equal, we prefer models that explain more of the outcome (e.g. higher R-squared values)

Easy model example: Striking a match explains creation of fire

MUCH more complicated example: Building a model of voting

- Many, many factors inform the decision to vote

- e.g. age, wealth, partisanship, history of prior voting

<br>

So, a model focused on just one of those will certainly have a small R^2 BUT might still offer us a useful estimate of the effect of that predictor on voting.

- The estimate is useful for testing our hypothesis even if the R^2 is small.

- Still valuable but not a complete model of the behavior.

::: notes

On the left is some fake data in a scatter plot

- This is showing you a strong, positive relationship between X and Y 

<br>

On the right is the residuals plot version of this same data

- Essentially the plot on the left is rotated so that the regression line is horizontal and placed on the zero line

- Distance on the y-axis represents the size of each residual (e.g. the difference between the observations and your regression line)

- The x-axis represents the the predictions of the regression line

<br>

R adds a red line to approximate the balance of the residuals across the predictions of the model

- If the line pulls well above or below zero then the balance is off

- Here we see a red line that indicates a more or less even spread of errors above and below the line.

<br>

This is what we would describe as a good result, e.g. homoscedastic errors

- From the Greek: Homo meaning "same" and skedastic meaning “able to be scattered”

- If your residuals plot looks like someone threw dots at a wall you're probably in good shape

::: notes

Heteroskedastic Errors are Bad

- Heteroskedasticity means that the variance of the errors is not constant across observations.

- In other words, when the scatter of the errors is different, varying depending on the value of one or more of the independent variables, the error terms are heteroskedastic.

<br>

In this hypothetical case our model makes much more accurate predictions at the low end than at the high end

- This is a bad sign

- It means our regression hasn't found a representative path through the conditional means

- **Any concerns with the patterns in these residuals?**

- (Yes, both kinds!)

FIRST, there is clearly some heteroskedasticity

- Model is super accurate for cheap diamonds and then varying accuracy for the rest

- Slight funneling effect from left to right (bigger on left than right)

<br>

SECOND, there is a clear non-linear trend

- Low values diamonds have mostly positive errors (under-predicts actual prices)

- High value diamonds have mostly negative errors (over-estimates actual prices)

Here's the data on presidential approval and the popular vote over the last 76 years

- The x-axis captures presidential approval in June of the election year

- The y-axis is the vote share earned in that November election

<br>

Pretty clear here that there is a strong positive relationship here

- In fact, the correlation is very high at `r round(cor(d$approval_june, d$vote_share, use = "pairwise"), 3)`

<br>

But what is the specific relationship?

- **SLIDE**: How do specific changes in approval translate into changes in vote share?

Ok, working in pairs I want you to analyze this regression line and make sure you:

1. Understand the formula for a line here, 

2. Can use that formula to make predictions, and

3. Have evaluated the data using all four evaluation steps

<br>

*Report back!*

<br>

**Per the regression, what is each percent of approval worth in terms of election returns?**

- (+1% approval = .47% increase in the election return)

<br>

**Per our regression line, what is the minimum June approval needed to crack 50% in the election?**

- June approval of 49% = `r predict(res1, newdata = data.frame(approval_june = 49))`

<br>

**Any concerns about the fit of the line to the data?**

- (No missing data)
- (Coefficients are significant)
- (R2 is pretty darn high, 71%)
- (Residuals unbalanced, maybe u-shaped error)

<br>

**Questions on our work today?**

<br>

For next class I have a practice exercise for you on Canvas!
