**AS STUDENTS COME IN MAKE THEM SIT IN NEW PLACES WITH NEW PEOPLE!**

- New rule, you can't sit next to the same people you did in the last class

- You HAVE to move around!

<br>

Quick aside before we get started today

- We'll start with data analyses in class on Wednesday

- If you're going to use one of the school laptops make sure to bring a USB flash drive for saving your work!

- **Can you let me know who will need to check out a laptop from the cart?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start today with an overview of your first report

:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Report 1**

**Analyzing our First Data Project**
:::

1. COMPLETED draft due Feb 21st

2. PDFs only

3. Support ALL claims with evidence
    - APA formatted in-text citations
    - APA formatted bibliography

4. Report should be concise and focused on your arguments

::: notes

Per the syllabus, a COMPLETED draft of your first report is due to be submitted to Canvas on Feb 21st

- Completed means all required components included, written in essay form with citations

- This draft submission IS your best effort to complete the paper

<br>

You must submit the report as a pdf file to preserve formatting of figures and tables

- Word allows you to export as pdf

<br>

You must support all claims with evidence which means:

- in-text citations, 

- a bibliography, and 

- APA formatting

<br>

**Questions on those basic elements?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: And what goes in the report?
:::



## Report 1 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

**What do we learn about the world from analyzing the Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders?**

<br>

The reader of your report is a non-expert in data analysis and is not familiar with this particular project, but is very interested in the topic. 

::: notes

Now that we have your project chosen I can make the report prompt much more focused!

- Focus on making an argument that answers THIS question for this type of reader

<br>

**Questions on the big picture aim here?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: The key elements

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**What do we learn about the world from analyzing the Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders?**

1. The importance of the project in the real-world,
2. The key contributors of uncertainty in the project's data,
3. What we learn about the current world from analyzing the most recently available data, and
4. What we learn about the trajectory of press freedom in the world from analyzing the data across time

::: notes

This first report focuses entirely on analyzing our first data project.

- Measurement is the end-all, be-all for any quantitative analysis and so we need to spend time analyzing the outcome BEFORE we can explain it!

<br>

Your report must have a clear macro structure and, I suggest, a meso structure that mirrors these four required elements. 

- Each of the required elements should be fully explained, all claims should be supported by evidence, and your report should offer the reader your critical analysis of that element.

<br>

This week we focus on just the first two sections (importance and confidence)

- Sections 3 and 4 won't happen until AFTER we learn the univariate analysis tools

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk Premise 1

:::



## Report 1 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**What do we learn about the world from analyzing the Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders?**

<br>

**Premise 1: Why is this project important?**

::: {.fragment}

- What problem are the researchers trying to solve?

- How does the problem impact the real world?

- Why should we take these researchers seriously?
 
- How has the project impacted the world?

:::

::: notes

In Premise 1 your job is to sell the importance of this project to an interested reader

- Don't assume the reader is an expert in the subject area

- Don't assume the reader is familiar with the project at all

- This means you have to include enough background info on the project for them to understand your importance argument

<br>

For example, If I were trying to convince a reader that a data project was important, I would make sure to answer the following questions

- **REVEAL**

<br>

To be clear, I will be providing time in class to work on the other premises in this report 

- This premise, which doesn't depend on data analyses, you'll be writing on your own outside of class

- **Any questions on the Premise 1 argument?**


<br>

**SLIDE**: On to Premise 2...

:::



## Report 1 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**What do we learn about the world from analyzing the Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders?**

<br>

**Premise 2: The key contributors of uncertainty?**

::: {.fragment}

- **Source:** Where does the raw data come from?

- **Operationalization:** Defining the concepts

- **Instrumentation:** Designing the tool

- **Measurement Process:** Using the tool

- **Validation:** Checking the data

:::

::: notes

After Section 1 sells the reader on the importance of the project, Section 2 is your chance to give the reader a crash course in the strengths and weaknesses of the project

- Remember, the reader is unfamiliar with the project

- Your job is to help them develop expertise so they can use it effectively to analyze the world

<br>

I want your Section 2 argument to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the project across a series of categories

- **REVEAL**

- Everybody write these down!

- Each of these categories should get at least a paragraph in this section and should include both strengths AND weaknesses

<br>

These elements can help you organize your critical analysis of any real-world data or measurement.

- We learn a great deal about the uncertainty in any measurement by investigating its sources, definitions, tools, processes and validation procedures.

- **Any questions on these categories?**

- Remember, the Brians et al reading has details on each of these.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Your assignment for today was meant to give you a jump-start on these analyses.

**For Today: Analyzing the First Codebook**
:::

<br>

1. Analyzing the Data Project Overall

    - What are the strengths and weaknesses of the overall data project? What variables should we consider using?
    
2. Analyzing the Selected Outcome 

    - What are the strengths and weaknesses of the variables we can choose as our key outcome to explain? 

::: notes

For today I asked each of you to read the codebook(s) and to reflect on how the researchers converted their ideas into measurements.

- My aim is that by the end of today you each have a list of strengths and weaknesses you can use to write Section 2 of the report.

<br>

And remember our key lesson from the first weeks of class: **Don't stress about the math!**

- Research design is WAY more important than the formulas!

<br>

Our focus today is on how the researchers define their ideas and convert them into numbers

- Those choices have a **MUCH** bigger impact than their choice to use harmonic means in constructing an index!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start with the first element of analyzing data

::: notes

Let's begin with the sources of the data being analyzed in this project.

- Small groups, get ready to report back on the source(s) of the data

- Make two lists, what are the strengths and weaknesses of these data sources

<br>

### Questions?

- Go!

- (*ON BOARD*)

<br>

**Given these two lists, how precise can we be when interpreting these numbers?**

- **In other words, how much uncertainty do these sources carry with them for our analyses?**

<br>

*RSF Notes from Methodology*

- "Our data gathering RSF’s staff constantly gathers information throughout the world about abuses against journalists in connection with their work."

- "The information about journalists who are held hostage, imprisoned, killed or missing is updated every day on RSF’s press freedom barometer."

**Operationalization: Defining the concepts**
:::

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_1-Voltaire_Define_Terms.jpg")
```

::: notes

As we did in Week 1 of the class, we now need to evaluate the operationalization of the concepts in this data project

- To refresh: Operationalization refers to ""...selecting observable phenomena to represent abstract concepts" (89).

- In other words, an "operational definition" tells us "precisely and explicitly what to do in order to determine what quantitative value should be associated with a variable in any given case" (p92).

<br>

**So, what are the key concepts in this data project?**

- (*Make list ON BOARD*)

<br>

Groups, take a few minutes to identify the operational definitions for these concepts and get ready to report back your evaluation of them

- Think about the operational definitions in terms of their clarity and validity

- Does the definition tell us "precisely and explicitly" what we are trying to measure?

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

*REPORT BACK and DISCUSS*
:::



## {background-image="Images/03_1-tools.jpg"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
<p style="color: white;">Instrumentation: Designing the tool</p>
:::

::: notes

Again, as you did in Week 1, instrumentation refers to how you convert your operational definition into a series of steps you can use to measure the concept in question.

- The clearer your operational definition, the easier it is to design your measurement tool

<br>

Groups, take a look at the tool used to produce the measures for our variable of interest

- Get ready to report back your evaluation of the tool

- Is it clear and does it map onto the operational definition(s)?

- In other words, does this tool accurately represent the underlying concept or not?

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

*REPORT BACK and DISCUSS*

<br>

- Questionnaire likely produce valid and reliable data?

- Does the calculation of the abuse score make sense? (next **SLIDE**)

**Measurement Process: Using the tool**
:::

![](Images/03_1-how_to_hammer.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Next we talk process.

- This is how the researchers use the tool to generate the actual measurements

- In other words, we give you a hammer (the tool) and then we give you instructions on how to use it (process) 

<br>

Groups, take a look at the process used to produce the measures for our variable of interest

- Get ready to report back on how reliable you believe this process to be

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

*REPORT BACK and DISCUSS*

- NEXT SLIDE HAS THE ABUSE SCORE DETAILS

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Validation: Checking the data**
:::

![](Images/03_1-Data_Validation.png)

::: notes

Last key piece for us to evaluate is validation.

<br>

As we have noted, measurement is REALLY difficult even when you try to do everything "right."

- This means we find it valuable when a research project tries to validate its findings with other high quality work. 

<br>

Groups, take a look at the validation processes in this data project

- Get ready to report back on how they do this and how effective you believe that will be

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

*REPORT BACK and DISCUSS*
