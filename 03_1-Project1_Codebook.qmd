## Report 1 {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

**Analyzing our Outcome Variable(s)**

<br>

1. Due Feb 23rd (Canvas "Assignments")

2. PDFs only

3. Support ALL claims with evidence
    - APA formatted in-text citations
    - APA formatted bibliography

::: notes

Per the syllabus, your first report is due to be submitted to Canvas on Feb 23rd

- Late submissions lose 10 points per day

<br>

You must submit the report as a pdf file to preserve formatting of figures and tables
- Word allows you to export as pdf

<br>

You must support all claims with evidence which means:
- in-text citations, 

- a bibliography, and 

- APA formatting

<br>

### Questions on those basic elements?

<br>

**SLIDE**: And what goes in the report?
:::


## Report 1 {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Analyzing our Outcome Variable(s)**
:::

::: notes

This first report focuses entirely on analyzing our first data project.

- Measurement is the end-all, be-all for any quantitative analysis and so we need to spend time analyzing it BEFORE we use it!

<br>

The report has four prompts and in each one it is your job to make and support an argument.

- Note that these requirements are on the Canvas assignment's page

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's step through the arguments you'll be making
:::



## Report 1 {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}
1) Why is this project important?

2) How confident should we be in the methodology?

3) What do the measures currently show us?

4) How are these measures changing across time?
:::

::: notes

1) In Section 1 your job is to sell the importance of this project to an interested reader

- Don't assume the reader is an expert in the subject area

- Don't assume the reader is familiar with the project at all

- This means you have to include enough background info on the project for them to understand your importance argument

<br>

2) Section 2 asks you to analyze the uncertainty in the data project and its measurements

- Your report should step through the strengths and weaknesses of the measurements in the project.
    -  Be specific and thorough here

- In other words, I want you to evaluate the sources of uncertainty in the data project, AND

- Discuss the implications of that uncertainty

<br>

3) In Section 3 of your report you will present your analysis of the most recent year available in the dataset

- We'll choose the year for this together based on what's available

<br>

4) Assuming the project gives us data across time, in Section 4 you will present an analysis of how the data has changed across time.

<br>

We will spend time in class on each of these elements, but you will have to do work outside class too.

- In addition, I'll give you a full week of classes before the due date to work on the report.

<br>

### Any questions on the structure of the report?
:::


## Report 1: Section 1 {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Why is this project important?**
:::

::: notes

Let's kick things off with a quick discussion of building a compelling argument in Section 1.

<br>

### If you were trying to sell an interested person on the idea that ANY data project was important, what aspects of it would you want to highlight? 

### - Think big picture here, what are the kinds of premises that would make this a compelling argument?

<br>

*ON BOARD: Small groups brainstorm topics and report back*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Things to consider...
:::


## Report 1: Section 1 {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

<br>

**Why is this project important?**

- What problem are the researchers trying to solve?

- How does the problem impact actors, institutions or interactions in the real world?

- Why should we take these researchers seriously? (e.g. credentials, funding, transparency, etc.) 
 
- Is there evidence that the project has had concrete impacts on the world?

::: notes

If I were you, I would think about things like these as I built my argument in Section 1.

<br>

### Questions on this?

<br>

**SLIDE**: I think the argument for Section 1 is consistent with the kinds of work you've done in many other classes, so I want to focus our time today on Section 2.
:::




## Report 1: Section 2 {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**How confident should we be in the methodology?**
:::

::: notes

As I mentioned previously, Section 2 of your paper makes an argument about your confidence in the measures produced by the data project.

- Think of this like our uncertainty discussions from the first week of class.

<br>

**SLIDE**: As with the argument in Section 1, the argument in Section 2 should hit a number of important elements.
:::



## Report 1: Section 2 {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

<br>

**How confident should we be in the methodology?**

- **Source:** Where does the raw data come from?

- **Operationalization:** Defining the concepts

- **Instrumentation:** Designing the tool

- **Measurement Process:** Using the tool

- **Validation:** Checking the data

::: notes

Everybody write these down!

<br>

These elements can help you organize your critical analysis of any real-world data or measurement.

- We learn a great deal about the uncertainty in any measurement by investigating its sources, definitions, tools, processes and validation procedures.

<br>

This list can also help you design your own data measurements!

- I don't mean to imply this is the only way to do it OR that this is always a linear process moving from one to the next

- Real research projects are iterative and have many feedback loops that come from doing the work.

<br>

However you end up building your own data one day, these represent the types of question you will need to be able to answer to convince others what you've made is useful.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Your assignment for today was meant to give you a jump-start on these analyses.
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/02_3-Assignment.png")
```

::: notes

For today I asked each of you to read the codebook(s) and to reflect on how the researchers converted their ideas into measurements.

- My aim is that by the end of today you each have a list of strengths and weaknesses you can use to write section 2 of the report.

<br>

And remember our key lesson from the first weeks of class: **Don't stress about the math!**

- Research design is WAY more important than the formulas!

<br>

Our focus today is on how the researchers define their ideas and convert them into numbers

- Those choices have a **MUCH** bigger impact than their choice to use harmonic means in constructing an index!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start with the first element of analyzing data
:::



## {background-image="Images/03_1-Source_of_Data.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Let's begin with the sources of the data being analyzed in this project.

- Small groups, get ready to report back on the source(s) of the data

- Make two lists, what are the strengths and weaknesses of these data sources

<br>

### Questions?

- Go!

<br>

*ON BOARD*
- "the responses of press freedom specialists (including journalists, researchers, academics and human rights defenders) to an RSF questionnaire available in 24 languages."
- "RSF’s staff constantly gathers information throughout the world about abuses against journalists in connection with their work."

<br>

### Given these two lists, how precise can we be when interpreting these numbers?

### - In other words, how much uncertainty do these sources carry with them for our analyses?

:::



## Operationalization {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_1-Voltaire_Define_Terms.jpg")
```

::: notes

After the data sources have been located, but before you can measure something specific, you must operationalize your concepts.

- *Brians, Craig Leonard, Lars Willnat, Jarol B. Manheim, and Richard C. Rich. 2011. “From Abstract to Concrete: Operationalization and Measurement.” In Empirical Political Analysis, Boston, MA: Longman, (ONLY p88-110)]*

<br>

Operationalization refers to ""...selecting observable phenomena to represent abstract concepts" (89).

- In other words, an "operational definition" tells us "precisely and explicitly what to do in order to determine what quantitative value should be associated with a variable in any given case" (p92).

- Let's say your interest is in measuring "democracy" then your operational definition would need to specify in great detail what precisely you mean by that word
    - e.g. free and fair elections, wide enfranchisement, rule of law, etc.
    
<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

### So, what are the key concepts in this data project?

- *ON BOARD*
- "Press Freedom", AND
- "Five Contextual Indicators"
    1. Political context
    2. Legal framework
    3. Economic context
    4. Sociocultural context
    5. Safety

<br>

Groups, take a few minutes to identify the operational definitions for these concepts and get ready to report back your evaluation of them

- Think about the operational definitions in terms of their clarity and validity

- Does the definition tell us "precisely and explicitly" what we are trying to measure?

<br>

### Questions?

- Go!

<br>

*REPORT BACK and DISCUSS*
:::



## {background-image="Images/03_1-tools.jpg"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
<p style="color: white;">Instrumentation</p>
:::

::: notes

Instrumentation refers to how you convert your operational definition into a series of steps you can use to measure the concept in question.

- The clearer your operational definition, the easier it is to design your measurement tool

<br>

Groups, take a look at the tool used to produce the measures for our variable of interest (The RSF Questionnaire)

- Get ready to report back your evaluation of the tool

- Is it clear and does it map onto the operational definition(s)?

- In other words, does this tool accurately represent the underlying concept or not?

<br>

### Questions?

- Go!

<br>

*REPORT BACK and DISCUSS*
:::

```
:::
::::

::: notes

Before we move to process we should also consider how 1/3 of the "safety score" for a country-year is determined by the "abuses score."

<br>

### Can you explain to me how they calculate the abuses score?

### - Even if you don't understand the math, talk to me about the choices they've made here to generate a result.

### - Strengths and weaknesses?

<br>

#### Notes
- Function designed to: 1) produce scores from 0 - 100, 2) approach zero as abuses increase

- Abuses summed together across 18? categories and weighted by seriousness of the type of abuse

- Descriptions cites "Three main levels of seriousness" but really shows a two part split using the Geneva Conventions but a wide variety of scores for different kinds of abuses
    - e.g. Abuse that does vs does not violate one of the rights in "Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions"

- Scaling abuse score by population is a very smart move given the huge variance in populations across states
    - But that doesn't mean this chosen approach (log_10) is the right one for this

## {background-image="Images/03_1-how_to_hammer.jpg"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
<p style="color: white;">**Tool + Process = Measurement**</p>
:::

::: notes

Next we talk process.

- This is how the researchers use the tool to generate the actual measurements

- In other words, we give you a hammer (the tool) and then we give you instructions on how to use it (process) 

<br>

**SLIDE**: Before we talk "process" let's talk criteria for evaluation.
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Tool + Process = Measurement**
:::

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_1-Reliability-and-Validity.png")
```

::: notes
**Has anybody ever seen a representation like this?**

- **What does this illustrate?**

<br>

All data can be evaluated in terms of its validity and reliability.

<br>

Validity
- How well does the data produced reflect the concept you are trying to measure?

- If the tool is badly designed, then the measures are meaningless or incomplete.

- This is what we just analyzed in in the instrumentation step

<br>

Reliability
- Does the tool + process produce consistent results across uses
    - could be across time, across region or across different researchers

- If the instructions are confusing (bad process) then each person who uses the tool will produce data that cannot be collected together

- Often with cross-national data collection each member of the research team focuses on different countries and the process is what keeps everyone measuring the same things in the same way.

<br>

Groups, take a look at the process used to produce the measures for our variable of interest

- Get ready to report back on how reliable you believe this process to be

<br>

### Questions?

- Go!

<br>

*REPORT BACK and DISCUSS*
:::



## {background-image="Images/03_1-Data_Validation.png" .center}

::: notes

Last key piece for us to evaluate is validation.

<br>

As we have noted, measurement is REALLY difficult even when you try to do everything "right."

- This means we find it valuable when a research project tries to validate its findings with other high quality work. 

<br>

Groups, take a look at the validation processes in this data project

- Get ready to report back on how they do this and how effective you believe that will be

<br>

### Questions?

- Go!

## Report 1: Section 2 {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

<br>

**How confident should we be in the methodology?**

- **Source:** Where does the raw data come from?

- **Operationalization:** Defining the concepts

- **Instrumentation:** Designing the tool

- **Measurement Process:** Using the tool

- **Validation:** Checking the data

::: notes
**Ok, how are we doing?**

- **Does everybody have a good start to Section 2?**

<br>

My advice, you should ABSOLUTELY check the academic literature on this topic

- There is quite a bit of research evaluating the RSF data AND using the RSF data to study the world

- Adding that material to your report will both 1) help you learn to critically analyze a data project AND 2) dramatically increase the credibility of your report!

<br>

### Any questions on our work for today?

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/03_1-Assignment.png")
```

::: notes

For Wed you have a reading and an assignment.

- The reading is meant to help you complete the assignment.

<br>

For the assignment I'd like you to dig into the dataset using Excel

- Focus on the 2023 data only (we'll get to the historical data later)

- Find us three interesting, puzzling or surprising things in the data (or just anything that stood out to you)

- Explain what you found and be specific.

<br>
