**Did everybody get these results for the tobacco regression?**

<br>

**Interpret the coefficient for me**

- As tobacco use in the adult population increases by 1%, average life expectancy increases by .2 years
    
    - So, add 5% more smokers and extend life expectancies by one year!

<br>

**What is obvious from this set of predictions?**

- The effect is POSITIVE and we know, based on the science, that there must be a problem here

<br>

**So, how well does the regression line fit the data?**

- **e.g. missing data, significance, R2, residuals**

<br>

- YES! Serious concerns with patterns in the residual

    - Appears like the regression line is missing a clear non-linear effect

- Also missing a ton of data!

<br>

I cannot emphasize enough the dangers of assuming a regression is a "good" summary of a relationship UNLESS you evaluate the fit of the line

- Here the significance star is especially dangerous

- Too many people see the star and think they've succeeded in finding truth!

- Regression is a tool and ALL tools are imperfect

<br>

Today I want to introduce you to different ways we can extend an OLS regression to fit different kinds of variables and relationships between X and Y

- **SLIDE**: Let's start with non-linearity

::: notes

Let's imagine we have some data on two variables that we can visualize with a simple scatter plot

<br>

**What is the relationship between X and Y here?**

- (As X increases from zero, Y steadily increases as well)

- (HOWEVER, at a certain point further increases in X lead to serious declines in Y)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's fit a simple OLS regression to this data

::: notes

Evaluate this regression for me.

- **Is this a good summary of the relationship or not?**

<br>

Per the usual metrics in the regression table this looks pretty darn good!

- HOWEVER, the residuals plot AND visualizing the data shows us there is a serious problem here

- If your takeaway stopped here you might recommend someone increase X forever to increase Y but we know that isn't what is happening in the relationship.

<br>

Ideally, what we'd like to see is the slope on X be larger in the beginning, but then to turn and become negative at the end

::: notes

Don't stress the math here, I just want you to remember that we can absolutely curve our lines using squared terms

- Or make all kinds of curves with additional polynomials

<br>

Knowing how to tweak the line in this way allows us to model:

1. exponential growth (e.g. the spread of a disease in a community)

2. exponential declines (e.g. the collapse of a resource)

3. effects that change across the levels of the predictor from positive to negative and back again (e.g. tobacco use and life expectancy!)

::: notes

Focus just on the intuition here.

- All I've done is include X twice in the regression

- One time it enters normally and the second time squared

- This allows the X variable to influence the prediction of the line in two ways

- Each increase in X increases Y by 0.95, AND

- Each increase in X^2 decreases Y by .04

<br>

Evaluate the fit of this new regression line for me

- **Is this a good summary of the relationship?**

- (We've improved on every one of the four evaluation steps, AND)

- (We've made a line that actually fits the data!)

<br>

Practice this logic for me

- **What does the regression predict for Y if X equals 3?**

- = -1.71 + .95*3 - .04*3^2

- = -1.71 + 2.85 - .36

- = .78

<br>

It's the exact same formula for a line but now we let X have two separate effects

- One time for each level of X, and

- One time for each squared value of X

- This allows the line to increase for a time and then eventually begin to fall

<br>

**Everybody with me here?**

- **Questions on this?**

::: notes

Think of this like a preview of multiple regression

- e.g. adding more variables to a regression

<br>

**Have we now improved the fit of the line to the data?**

- **In other words, is this a better summary of the relationship?**

- Added a significant coefficient, increased the R2 by a lot, reduced the error, fixed the nonlinear residuals!

<br>

**Ok, what is the story of this line?**

- **How does tobacco use relate to life expectancy in our global sample?**

<br>

- At low levels of tobacco use the first coefficient is bigger than the second

    - e.g. tobacco use extends life expectancies on average

- HOWEVER, once you get beyond the mid-20s in tobacco use, the second coefficient starts to outweigh the increases

    - So, even though the squared coefficient is tiny it gets added thousands of times at the high end of the scale

<br>

**Anybody want to take a stab at explaining why we might see this relationship in the real world?**

- **Do we think tobacco use actually improves lives?**

<br>

(Definitely not. My guess is this is a proxy for wealth at the low end)

- As income goes up from a very low point access to entertainment products like tobacco increases

- BUT, at a certain point the effect of the tobacco use harms health and lowers life expectancies

<br>

Pretty cool, right?

- **Questions on adding a squared predictor to curve the line?**

Watch a movie and ask three questions:

1. Are there at least two named female characters?

2. Do the two female characters talk to each other?

3. Is the conversation about something other than a man?

<br>

ONLY if the movie answers yes to all three questions does it pass the test.

I've written the result as the formula for a line to see if that helps us understand what we've made here.

- In this case, the intercept represents the average for movies that failed the test

- **Make sense?**

<br>

*Step through all*

- The coefficient represents the average change in box office for movies that pass the Bechdel Test

- The intercept represents the average change in box office for movies that fail the Bechdel Test

- SO, regression on a dummy variable estimates the group means (with confidence intervals)

- Compare to group means in "Other" tab

- Hard to interpret the residuals plot (what is the middle of a dummy variable?)

<br>

So, per this regression it appears that sexist movies make way more money on average than movies that treat women like real people!

I've written the result as the formula for a line to see if that helps us understand what we've made here.

**So, what is going on here?**

- **What are these regression results telling us?**

*Step through all*

Only ONE of these predictors can be true at the same time so only ONE coefficient gets added to the intercept

- Remember, the intercept represents the average box office for dubious movies (unclear Bechdel result)

- Pass the test and subtract $76.4 million

- Don't include named women and subtract $17 million

- Have women but don't let them talk and ADD $31.5 million!

- Have women but they only talk about men and subtract $36 million

SO, regression on a categorical variable estimates the group means (with confidence intervals)
