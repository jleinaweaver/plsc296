**Has everybody submitted their proposal to Canvas?**

<br>

Alright, today you'll take turns pitching us on your proposals

- I'll try to load the news story you selected on the screens at the front of the room

- At the end we'll choose one (or merge a few) and that will be our primary focus for the term

<br>

### Questions before we start?

- Let's go!

- *ON BOARD: Build a topic list to refer back to*

<br>

*Make sure by the end of class we have:*
- A draft research question
- A data project for the outcome with a shared link to the codebook
- A first choice of variable that measures the outcome of our project
