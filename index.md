[Week 1, Class 1](https://github.com/jleinaweaver/plsc296/blob/f85e7e89f60bd5492e0909451dffa3b3344f4547/01_1-Welcome_to_296.html)


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jleinaweaver/plsc296/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jleinaweaver/plsc296/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
