Prep for Class

1. Make the merged data file available on Canvas

## For Today {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

### Submit your "best" visualization of the relationship between:

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. The style (`cut`) and clarity (`clarity`) of the diamonds

2. The style (`cut`) and the cost (`price`) of the diamonds

3. The size (`carat`) and the cost (`price`) of the diamonds

:::

::: notes
Ok, here's what I asked you to do for class today

- My hope is that this gave you a chance to practice all of the visualizations from last class, PLUS

- A chance to practice our polishing skills again

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's step through each challenge one-by-one

:::



## How did you visualize the relationship between `cut` and `clarity`? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/09_3-Diamond_Cut.png")
```

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/09_3-Diamond_Clarity.jpg")
```

::: notes
Alright, let's see what everybody made!

- *Encourage everyone to walk around and see all the plots*

<br>

**What are we seeing? What do we like?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Here's my stab

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.618, fig.width=8, cache=TRUE}

## Diamonds: 'cut' and 'price' {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.asp=1, fig.width=6, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = forcats::fct_rev(cut))) +

::: {.column width="55%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.asp=1.1, fig.width=7, cache=TRUE}

  facet_wrap(~ cut, ncol = 1) +

  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) 
```

::: notes
The distributions overlap considerably.

- Doesn't look like cut and price are highly correlated!

<br>

**Any guesses why cut and price appear uncorrelated here?**

- (Size, e.g. carats, matters in diamonds a ton!)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last one focuses on size!

## How did you visualize the relationship between `carat` and `price`? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

## Diamonds: 'carat' and 'price' {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center .smaller}

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.width=7, fig.asp=.7, cache=TRUE}
#| code-fold: true

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .05) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Size of the Diamond (carats)", y = "Prices",
       title = "The larger the diamond the more expensive!") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())
```

::: notes
The alpha argument in geom_point is new for our class pictures

- Given the 50k diamonds in the dataset it can be VERY hard to see through the cloud of points

- The alpha changes the opacity of the points, e.g. how dark each one is

- I've set the alpha SUPER low so we can try to see somewhat through the cloud

<br>

**Does anything interesting stand out in this plot thanks to the very low alpha setting?**

- The dark vertical bands at round-ish numbers of carats (1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2) implies jewelers are actively making cuts in order to create tiers in the market

- If they cut what they got in order to preserve the original size everytime we'd see much more variation

- The diamond market is ten layers of nonsense and marketing

## Bivariate Analyses {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Descriptive Statistics by Group
    - Counts, Proportions, Means, Medians, Standard Deviations, Percentiles, Ranges, Interquartile Ranges (IQR) and Correlations

2. Visualizations
    - Bar plots (stacked, side-by-side, proportions), box plots and scatter plots

::: notes
**Any questions on our bivariate analyses tools?**

<br>

My expectation from here on out is that you can use all of these tools in R

<br>

Ok, let's use our class time today to apply these tools to our developing research project.

- Let's brainstorm a plan of attack!

- **Given our research question AND the variables in our merged dataset, what bivariate analyses should we produce?**

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

Get to it!
