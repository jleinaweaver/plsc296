Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. IFF you have time, consider adding some of the best submissions as slides to share and celebrate in class!

<br>

Last class, we began exploring data from the World Bank's WDI database.

- A very useful repository of national statistics from something around 217 "economies" around the world.

<br>

Today I want us to:

1. Review your practice exercises,

2. Discuss how to use what you are producing to make arguments, and

3. Learn some tools for analyzing data across time

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's refresh our rules for making high quality visualizations

```

::: notes

**Evaluate this visualization for me.**

- **What does it do well? What does it do poorly?**

<br>

This visualization gives me nightmares

- Don't use 3-d if the 3-d provides ZERO new information

- Make the axis scales logical!

- I don't think these are continents...

- Where does this data come from?

- What do these bars actually show?

- Why are there drop shadows?!?!?

<br>

My hope is that as we work with data and grapple with the importance of uncertainty for our knowledge you will begin to see just how AWFUL many visualizations are.

- **SLIDE**: To refresh

::: notes
As we discussed last class, we will produce high quality data visualizations in this class

- This means that every chance we have to make something, we want to be producing visualizations that would look good in any presentation, report, book, web post, poster, etc.

- e.g. practice as you mean to go on!

<br>

**Any questions on these expectations?**

<br>

**Were you able to implement these in your submissions for today?**

## Based on your analyses of this data, what is the state of global development in 2021? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: notes

**Ok, how did your assignment for today go?**

- **Any trouble copying images into Canvas? Or polishing the visualizations?**

<br>

**Based on this data and your analyses, what would you argue is the current state of global development?**

- **Is the world currently in pretty good or bad shape?**

- e.g. measles_herd_immunity, measles_immunizations_pct, WB Income, gdp_per_capita, birth_rate, death_rate

<br>

*Encourage this discussion, Get different answers!*

- *Summary stats at bottom*

<br>

Ultimately, one of the challenges for us as data scientists is in trying to answer what seem like simple questions using data.

- As I'm sure you saw from this exercise, data doesn't speak for itself

- Interpreting data requires understanding the context of the measurement AND the context of the problem

<br>

So, how do we give the reader the context they need to understand what we see in the data?

- **SLIDE**: Today I want to talk through some of the options you have to do this

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(data2021$gdp_per_capita)
summary(data2021$measles_immunizations_pct)
table(data2021$measles_herd_immunity)
summary(data2021$measles_immunizations_pct)
summary(data2021$birth_rate)
summary(data2021$death_rate)
```

## Is this "good"? Are we doing well? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.retina=3, fig.asp=.75, out.width='100%', fig.width=8}
data2021$measles1 <- if_else(data2021$measles_immunizations_pct < 96, "risk", "immune")

data2021 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = measles_immunizations_pct)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Measles Immunizations (% under 2 years)", y = "Countries")
```

::: notes

Let's start with our simple histogram of measles immunizations in 2021

- **In simplest terms, describe what you see here**

- (A left-skewed distribution)

- (Mode appears to be near 100%)

- (At least a few countries very, very low)

<br>

These simple descriptions are the baseline for what you should be able to do.

- You should absolutely be able to describe the picture, but that is not enough

- YOUR JOB as the data analyst is to ANALYZE and INTERPRET the data you see here

<br>

**What did we use when analyzing measles last class to make an argument about good vs bad performance?**

- **In other words, what context did we provide the reader?**

- (**SLIDE**: The herd immunity threshold of 95%)

  geom_bar(fill = c("red", "blue", "blue")) +
  labs(x = "Measles Immunizations (% under 2 years)", y = "Countries", title = "Too many countries remain vulnerable \n to measles outbreaks (< 95% vaccinated)")
```
:::
::::

::: notes

Your first option when analyzing univariate analyses like these is to give your reader the context they need to interpret what they see.

- In this case, herd immunity or the % needed to ensure a contagion would not spread out of control

- This 95% figure represents a benchmark for interpreting this data

- Benchmark: a standard or point of reference against which things may be compared or assessed.

<br>

Without the context of the herd immunity threshold it would be much harder for us to interpret and explain the substantive importance of these visualizations

- WITH the context we can polish these plots to make ABSOLUTELY clear what we learn from them

<br>

**Does this make sense?**

- My expectation for your assignments in this class is that you are good at describing the data AND analyzing it!

<br>

**What benchmark did I give you for the global wealth data?**

::: notes

I'll give you the code to reorder the bars in a bar plot in one sec, but first...

- **Which of these is the "better" answer to the question, what is the state of global development in 2021?**

- **In other words, which is the more "accurate" takeaway? Is most of the world "rich" or "poor"?**

<br>

- If you only give someone the histogram we see a very poor world with a few very wealthy outliers

- If you only give someone the bar plot we see a fairly rich world with a few very poor countries

- We need BOTH to wrap our heads around the distributions of wealth around the world

- The plot on the left helps us see the political nature of the categories produced by the World Bank

- The plot on the right helps us think about development in a more nuanced way than just dollars in a bank account

<br>

**How are we doing with this?**

- **Is everybody clear on the difference between describing the plot and analyzing it?**

<br>

KEY TAKEAWAY: Analysis often requires context and benchmarks are one very useful way to provide that context!

- The handy thing here is that this just requires you to pair two visualizations together, no new code required!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Here is the code you need to re-order the bars in a bar plot
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Use scale_x_discrete to reorder bars in bar plot
ggplot(data2021, aes(x = wb_income)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "green3") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Low", "Lower-middle",
                              "Upper-middle", "High", NA))

  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Low", "Lower-middle", "Upper-middle", 
                              "High", NA))
```

::: notes

To keep the code readable on the slide I added space between upper-middle and high, you don't need that space

- You can just keep it all on one line

  annotate("text", x = 8.5, y = 34, label = "CHN")
```

:::

::: notes

Another option is to label specific observations

- For an American audience I can imagine this helping us think about the world relative to our own experiences.

- *Show each of the two plots*

<br>

Whereas the benchmark approach required a number as context

- This approach uses an observation as context

- **Make sense?**

Here is the code you need to add text to any plot

- Specify you are adding "text"

- Pinpoint the spot using x and y coordinates

Test it out.

- Try adding random text somewhere on the plot, and

- an arrow

::: notes

The third way we can add context to our analyses is with across time data

- In other words, we can compare observations to themselves at different points in time

<br>

The WDI dataset I provided you has country-year data going back to 1985

- So let's use that data to see how measles vaccinations have changed over time!

## Practice Exercises {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

**Questions to Answer:**

1. Are birth rates rising or falling around the world? (`birth_rate`)

2. Is the world getting richer or more unequal over time? (`wb_income`)

::: notes
Use each question as your chance to practice all of our tools:

- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate the minimum, the median and the maximum for each variable at three snapshots in time (1985, 2003, 2021)

- Bar plots: Visualize `wb_income` at three snapshots in time (1985, 2003, 2021)

- Histograms: Visualize `death_rate` at three snapshots in time (1985, 2003, 2021)

- Animation: Transform one of the visualizations into an animation across all the years in the dataset

<br>

**THEN, submit your answer to each question with only the evidence you need to support your analyses. (3+ sentences each)**

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**
