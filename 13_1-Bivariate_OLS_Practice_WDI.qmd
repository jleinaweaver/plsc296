Prep for Class

1. Check Canvas submissions

<br>

Kick us off with a big question!

- **Tell me, why do we use regressions?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## Why use OLS regressions? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

- **Quantifies the relationship** between variables

- Uses **ALL** of the data

- Makes predictions with estimates of **uncertainty**

- Gives us **criteria** for evaluating the fit of the line

**Future Weeks**

- Can be adjusted for confounders (e.g. control variables), nonlinear relationships and different data structures

::: notes

**Any questions on our work last week on regression?**

- **e.g. the intuitions, interpretations, evaluations or methods in R?**

## Assignment For Today {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

What is the effect of college completion on poverty rates in midwest cities?

1. Fit the regression

2. Submit a polished regression table, residuals plot and predictions plot

3. Answer the question

4. Evaluate the regression

::: notes

**How did this go? Toughest part?**

<br>

*Save your conclusions/results for the next slide*

<br>

**What is the effect of college completion on poverty rates in midwest cities?**

<br>

**In real-world terms, is this a small or large effect? Did you expect something different?**

<br>

**How confident are you in this regression as a summary of the relationship?**

::: notes

**Did everybody get these results?**

<br>

**Scatter: Does everybody see why this summary has such a low R2 value?**

- (The line doesn't cover the actual full range of outcome values)

- (HOWEVER, this might still be a USEFUL estimate of this relationship)

- Don't forget, our goal is a best estimate of the slope, NOT the highest R2 possible

<br>

**Any missing data problems?**

- (No)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
nrow(midwest)
```

<br>

**Residuals: Any concerns with patterns or heteroscedasticity in the residuals?**

- (A hint of non-linearity but not a deal-breaker)

<br>

**Predictions: Are these moves in poverty a big deal or not?**

- Be careful interpreting the predictions plot

- This is designed to make the slow fill the entire space, YOU have to recognize how little range is visualized on the y-axis

- *Show Predictions 2 with full range of the data*

<br>

**Predictions 2: How does this change our sense of the relationship?**

<br>

**Assuming we want this small effect, how hard would it be to increase college completion rates in meaningful ways?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our plan for today is to keep practicing all of these skills!

::: notes

I've uploaded World Bank data to our Canvas modules for today

- Everybody grab that data!

<br>

Countries around the world vary dramatically in terms of their life expectancies

- Ireland: 82
- USA: 76
- Russia: 71
- Afghanistan: 62
- Nigeria: 53

<br>

Our job today is to use regressions to identify and evaluate possible answers to the question of why people in some countries tend to live longer than those in others

Task: Fit, interpret and evaluate each model

::::
:::::

::: notes
Work with the people around you to fit and evaluate three regressions of life expectancy

- Model 1 regresses life expectancy on the fertility rate per woman

- Model 2 regresses life expectancy on the number of years of education you are required to complete

- Model 3 regresses life expectancy on the proportion of adults who are unemployed

<br>

Your job:

1. Fit each model,

2. Interpret the coefficient, 

3. Make predictions using the model, and then 

4. Evaluate each model with our four steps

**Did everybody get these results for the fertility rate regression?**

<br>

**Interpret the coefficient for me**

- As average births per woman increases by one, life expectancy decreases by almost 5 years!

<br>

**What is obvious from this set of predictions?**

- The effect is DRAMATICALLY larger

- ONE additional child is a 5 year decrease in life expectancy (on average)!

- The effect of fertility rate on life expectancy is staggeringly large!

<br>

**So, how well does the regression line fit the data?**

- **e.g. missing data, significance, R2, residuals**

<br>

Once again, let's reinforce what the R2 is meant to tell us

- Here we see a high R2 value, e.g. almost 70% of the outcome is explained by this one predictor

- The blue line covers the complete range of the outcomes!

<br>

**Any concerns with heteroskedasticity in the fertility rate regression?**

- Slight non-linearity here but the effect is rather minor

- Does appear that we have fewer cases at the low end of the scale (e.g. very high fertility rates) and so the model fits this extreme less well

**Did everybody get these results for the education regression?**

<br>

**Interpret the coefficient for me**

- Add one year of compulsory education and see an average increase of life expectancies by almost one year

<br>

**What is obvious from this set of predictions?**

- A country with ZERO required school that implements a primary education requirement will see, on average, an improvement of 4 years of life expectancy
    - 0 to 6 yrs education = 69.64-65.31 = 4.33
    
- A country moving from a primary only requirement to a secondary ed requirement will see, on average, an improvement of 4 years of life expectancy

- Do both and add 8 years!

<br>

**So, how well does the regression line fit the data?**

- **e.g. missing data, significance, R2, residuals**

<br>

Once again, let's reinforce what the R2 is meant to tell us

- Here we see a VERY low R2 value, e.g. almost 7% of the outcome is explained by this one predictor

- The blue line covers only a small subset of the outcomes

- BUT our interest is in the effect, not perfectly predicting the outcome

<br>

**Any concerns with heteroskedasticity in the education regression?**

- This residual plot shows the flaw in just relying on the red line because it's tracking changes across the levels that are probably just scattered randomly

- Some evidence of heteroskedasticity: At the low end error is high, at the high end it's the opposite

- Probably not a deal breaker but not a clear case of homoscedasticity

<br>

**So, if you ran a development agency would you get more bang from your buck focusing on women's rights and healthcare or increasing compulsory education?**

::: notes

**Did everybody get these results for the unemployment regression?**

<br>

**Interpret the coefficient for me**

- As the unemployment rate increases by 1%, average life expectancy decreases .12 years
    
    - So, add 8% unemployment and shave one year off of average life expectancies!

<br>

**What is obvious from this set of predictions?**

- Negative but the effect magnitude is TINY

<br>

**So, how well does the regression line fit the data?**

- **e.g. missing data, significance, R2, residuals**

<br>

- Some missing data, insignificant coefficient, some problems in the residuals plot

<br>

Once again, let's reinforce what the R2 is meant to tell us

- Here we see a VERY, VERY, VERY low R2 value, e.g. not even 1% of the outcome is explained by this one predictor

- The blue line covers basically none of the outcomes

- BUT our interest is in the effect, not perfectly predicting the outcome
