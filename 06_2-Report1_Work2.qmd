### Any questions on the assignment in big picture?
:::


## Section 3 {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

**What do the measures currently show us?**

<br>

1. Analyze the current distribution of the `Total` index score

2. Analyze the current distribution of one of the indicators in the dataset

<br>

**Each variable requires a histogram, descriptive statistics and country examples for context**

::: notes

On Monday we worked on the data analyses for Section 3

### Is everybody in good shape with this?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today, Section 4
:::



## Section 4 {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

**How are these measures changing across time?**

<br>

1. Analyze the Total index score **AND** your assigned indicator across time (make an argument supported by histograms and descriptive statistics for the years 2006 and 2014)

2. Select a country that has experienced variation in its Total score **AND** your assigned indicator across time (e.g. avoid the stable cases). Analyze the experience of that country using line plots.

::: notes

Two big picture tasks in this section of the paper

1. You will deepen your Section 3 analysis by analyzing the two measures from that section across time (histograms by time snapshots)
    - You've already looked at 2023 in Section 3 so use this as an opportunity to look backwards across time

2. Analyze the trajectory of a single country that has experienced variation in its `Total` fragility score across time
    - Keep this interesting, avoid the stable cases
    
    - Use line plots for the `Total` score and whichever indicators are most interesting for this case

### Questions on Section 4?

- Let's get to it!

I am giving you Friday in class to finish the reports
