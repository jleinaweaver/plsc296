# Our Research Project {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

-   Report 1: Analyze the Outcome Variable(s)

-   Report 2: Analyze the Predictor Variable(s)

-   Report 3: Test the causal mechanism

:::

::: notes
Our project this semester builds up, as all good projects must, in an iterative fashion.

-   We begin by analyzing variables on their own, then together

<br>

This iterative process allows us to learn the coding and statistics we need in a slow, deliberate fashion.

-   So, lots of time to boost our confidence in the tools and to practice applying and interpreting them.

<br>

**SLIDE**: To complete the first two reports you will need a set of skills we refer to as univariate analyses

A univariate analysis is one that focuses on a single variable on its own

<br>

This week these are the tools we'll be learning to code and interpret.

-   This is the complete list of things I will expect to see you use and explain on the first two reports.

<br>

Write these down!

-   Use this like a checklist for yourself as we go

<br>

Your job is to make sure that YOU

1. Can make each one in R, and 
    
2. How to interpret their results

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, so why do we need univariate analyses?
:::


## What do we do with data? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(543)
d <- round(runif(265, 100, 250), 0)
d
```

::: notes
Imagine you had collected all of this data 

- As a simple list this is an overwhelming amount of information for anyone to read let alone understand.

- Univariate analyses refer to a series of tools that allow you to summarize a big list of data points into something more digestible

<br>

Imagine this is a list of house prices in the USA

- **Per the reading, what options do you have to summarize this collection of data?**

- **In other words, how could we use descriptive statistics to learn something about house prices in the US today?**

<br>

- The range would tell us the gap between the cheapest and most expensive houses
    - How big is the inequality gap?

- The mean would tell us the average home price

- The median would tell us the "middle" home price

- The standard deviation tells us how much house prices in the US differ from the average
    - The bigger the number, the more spread out house prices are around the average

- We could use the range to find the cheapest and most expensive houses and the spread between them

<br>

So, lot's of options!

- **Are you clear on these concepts from the reading?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: The key here is to realize that THIS is the problem statistics was invented to solve!

# Defining Statistics {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Level 1**

Statistics is a set of tools we use to summarize data

:::

::: notes
*READ SLIDE*

<br>

By summarize I mean to "give a brief statement of the main points of (something)" (Oxford Dictionary).

<br>

So, at its most basic level, statistics is about summary

- AND summary is incredibly useful for developing understanding about the world.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Statistics also carries with it some deeper ambitions!

:::


# Defining Statistics {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

<br>

**Level 2**

"The practice or science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of **inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample**" (Oxford Dictionary).

::: notes
In simpler terms, statistics also gives us the tools to learn things about an entire population based only on the summaries of data from a sample of that population.

-   e.g. This survey of 2,300 Americans tells us how popular Pres Biden is...

<br>

So, those are the big, initial goals.

-   The takeaway is that univariate analyses and descriptive statistics, even if they seem simple, can be INCREDIBLY powerful tools for learning about the world.

**Create an R Script and name it "Descriptive Statistics.R"**
:::

- Option 1: "File" &#8594; "New File" &#8594; "R Script"

- Option 2:

![](Images/03_3-New_Script.png){.absolute bottom=0 left=200}


::: notes
Let's set off on the right foot!

-   Create a new script file for your notes today and label it descriptive statistics.

<br>

Last week we used R as a calculator on single numbers and on a vector of numbers.

-   Starting today we'll be using R to work with data, but the logic of taking notes and writing code work the exact same

-   If you get confused, don't forget the Healy reading from Friday walks you through the way R does things and why we use functions!
:::

##  {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/04_1-mpg_dataset.png")
```

```{r}
mpg |>
  slice_sample(n = 6) |>
  select(manufacturer:trans) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(align = 'c') |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 25) |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:6, background = "white")
```

::: notes
R includes a number of built-in data sets for practice.

-   Each extra package tends to bring more practice data as well.

<br>

The "mpg" data set is provided as part of an extra package.

-   "This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data that the EPA makes available on https://fueleconomy.gov/."

-   'mpg' has data on 234 cars (observations) across 11 variables

<br>

**SLIDE**: To access the data set...
:::

## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center .larger}

::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Load the packages
library(tidyverse)

# View the dataset in the console
mpg

# View the dataset in a spreadsheet (sortable columns)
View(mpg)

# List all of the variables in the dataset
names(mpg)

# Access any single variable
mpg$manufacturer
```
:::

::: notes
Everybody copy these notes (with a #) and make sure you can run each piece of code.

-   You will primarily write code in R to either input data or apply functions to that data.

-   As you see here, functions are a word (or words) followed by parentheses.

<br>

### Did it all work for you?

<br>

Relevant notes from Healy:

1.  R is essentially a collection of functions each of which lets you do something useful using data
    -   View() means show me the data in a spreadsheet
    -   names() means tell me what variables are in this dataset
2.  R is case sensitive so you have to write the code EXACTLY
    -   the "V" in view is capitalized
3.  We can use \$ to access a single variable at a time in a dataset

## 3. Variable type determines the tool {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_2-levels_measurement.png")
```

::: notes
Now, as we start calculating descriptive statistics don't forget our third principle of data analysis

-   Variable Type Determines Tool

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today we start applying this insight
:::

## 3. Variable type determines the tool {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mpg$manufacturer
```
::::

::: notes
We'll start by summarizing or describing categorical variables

<br>

When you ask R to show you a single variable with "$" it will provide all the observations in a list.

- The numbers in brackets on the side is which number observation starts that row

<br>

### Refresh my memory, why is manufacturer a categorical variable?

-   (e.g. those with observations defined as categories or levels)

<br>

The mpg dataset has the manufacturer information for 234 cars

-   That's a rather hard to digest list

<br>

### Per your readings for today, how do we summarize or describe this categorical variable?

-   (Categorical variables can be summarized as either counts or proportions.)

-   e.g. make a table of counts or proportions

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's do those things in R!
:::

## If you have a categorical variable... {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

:::: {.r-fit-text}
**1. Count the levels with table()**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
table(mpg$manufacturer)
```

**2. Convert to proportions with proportions()**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
proportions(table(mpg$manufacturer))
```
::::

::: notes
**Everybody got the code written down and working?**

<br>

- Our first line of code uses the table function to count the levels in the variable

- Our second line uses a function on a function - Basically the input for proportions is the result of the table function

<br>

**So, what is the most common car manufacturer in this dataset?**

<br>

**What is the least?**

<br>

**Questions? Got it working?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's practice!
:::




## What count and proportion of cars in `mpg` are four-wheel drive (`drv`)? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.r-fit-text}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Make a table of drivetrains
table(mpg$drv)

# Convert the table of counts into proportions
proportions(table(mpg$drv))
```
:::
::::

::: notes
Use the code we just wrote to answer this question

-   Same dataset, just focus on a different categorical variable.

<br>

*Show Results*: That's all there is to it.

-   Descriptive stats on categorical variables is super easy.

-   Count the levels and, optionally, convert the count to a proportion

<br>

It looks like very few of the "popular" cars in this dataset from 1999 - 2008 were rear-wheel drive.
:::


## 3. Variable type determines the tool  {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.r-fit-text}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(width = 75)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mpg$cty
```

::::

::: notes

Now, what if you'd like to summarize a numeric variable instead of a categorical one?

-   Let's go back to our third principle again!

<br>

**Why can't we use the same tools (tables) we just used for categorical variables?**

-   (Long numeric variables will have tons and tons of different values which, in a table, would require a massive number of columns)

-   Not much simpler than just reviewing the data

<br>

**SLIDE**: As you saw in the reading, we have lots of good options for summarizing numeric variables.
:::



## If you have a numerical variable... {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Measures of Central Tendency**

:::: {.r-fit-text}

**1. Find the average value with mean()**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(mpg$cty)
```

<br>

**2. Find the median value with median()**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
median(mpg$cty)
```

::::

::: notes

Let's find the middle!

**Everybody got the code written down and working?**

<br>

Let's make sure the intuition is clear.

**Per the reading, what's the difference between the median and the mean?**

<br>

**And what do we learn about a numeric variable if the mean and the median are very close to each other?**

-   (No big outliers!)
:::




## What is the "middle" highway fuel economy (`hwy`) in `mpg`? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.r-fit-text}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
1. Find the average with mean() 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(mpg$hwy)
```

2. Find the median value with median()
```{r, echo=TRUE}
median(mpg$hwy)
```
:::

::::

::: notes
So, you can summarize a data distribution with the mean or median as its middle, BUT

-   How do we know if the "middle" is a good summary?

-   **SLIDE**: We need to check the spread of the data!
:::



## If you have a numerical variable... {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Measures of the Spread**

:::: {.r-fit-text}

**Use summary() for a selection of descriptive stats**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mpg$cty)
```

<br>

**Use sd() for the standard deviation**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
sd(mpg$cty)
```

::::

::: notes

Everybody write down the code and make sure it works.

<br>

Let's talk about what summary() gives you from the outside in

- On the ends the summary output gives you the minimum and maximum values (e.g. the range)
    
- Next comes the 25th and 75th percentiles (e.g. the IQR or middle 50%)

- The middle two values are two measures of the "middle"

<br>

The only fairly standard thing summary() doesn't give you is the std dev

<br>

**Any questions on these descriptive stats covered in the reading?**

<br>

**Notes**

*If they ask about percentiles* 

- The most common definition of a percentile is a number where a certain percentage of scores fall below that number. 
- In statistics, a k-th percentile (percentile score or centile) is a score below which a given percentage k of scores in its frequency distribution falls (exclusive definition) or a score at or below which a given percentage falls (inclusive definition).

*If they ask about Std Dev*: 

- Hopefully building visualizations in our next two classes will help make this concept clearer! 
- Long story short, a measure of how far each data point is from the average...

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='20%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/04-1-Std_Dev_Formula.svg")
```

## What is the earliest and latest `year` in the `mpg` dataset? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.r-fit-text}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mpg$year)

min(mpg$year)

max(mpg$year)
```
:::
::::

::: notes
Practice time!

I'm also using this as a chance to show you the functions for calculating the minimum or maximum alone.
:::



## Is it more useful to summarize the number of engine cylinders (`cyl`) as a table() or with summary()? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.r-fit-text}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Analyze as a numeric variable
summary(mpg$cyl)

# Analyze as a categorical variable
table(mpg$cyl)
```
:::
::::

::: notes
One more quick hit practice!

-   Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between a numeric and a categorical variable with levels represented by numbers!

-   Make both and tell me which you would use in a report meant to describe the distribution of cars

<br>

**What conclusion do you draw from these statistics?**

<br>

The table makes clear that most cars are 4, 6 or 8 cylinders and the distribution is quite even across them (in this dataset)

-   Measures of the "middle" in a sense misrepresent these categories

-   The "average" of a Ford F150 and Kia Sorento doesn't really mean what we might think it does

<br>

The lesson: Sometimes categorical variables use numbers!

-   Be careful.
