## For Today {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

1. Which party has controlled the presidency the most since 1953?

2. What do most counties in the midwest look like in population terms?

3. How significant is the problem of poverty in the US midwest?

4. How many hours per day do you have to sleep to sleep longer than 75% of studied mammals? Which mammals do you sleep most like in terms of length?

5. How much better is the fuel economy of cars driving on the highway versus driving in the city?

::: notes

**How did this go?**

- **Everybody building their R skills a bit?**

<br>

**SLIDE:** Let's step through the questions

:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Which party has controlled the presidency the most since 1953?**

(Built-in Data: presidential, Variable: party)

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
proportions(table(presidential$party))
```

::: notes

**How did you attack this?**

<br>

**Is this a "good" answer? Why or why not?**

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**What do most counties in the midwest look like in population terms?**

(Built-in Data: midwest, Variable: poptotal)

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(midwest$poptotal)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sd(midwest$poptotal)
```

::: notes

**So, what's your answer to this question?**

<br>

On average, the cities in the midwest differ from the mean by nearly 300k!

- Huge variance in city sizes

- Some VERY small (sub-2k) and some MASSIVE (5+ million)

<br>

**Which way do the counties in the midwest skew: Positive or negative?**

- **What does that mean in real-world terms?**

- (Huge positive skew! Some really big counties out there!)

<br>

**So, most counties look like what in population terms?**


:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**How significant is the problem of poverty in the US midwest?**

(Built-in Data: midwest, Variables: percbelowpoverty, percchildbelowpovert)

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(midwest$percbelowpoverty)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(midwest$percchildbelowpovert)
```

::: notes

Depends, right?

- The poorest counties are in REALLY bad shape

- BUT, the third quartile is fairly low so 75% of counties in not terrible shape (depending on what prop you are comfortable with)


:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**How many hours per day do you have to sleep to sleep longer than 75% of studied mammals?**

(Built-in Data: msleep, Variable: sleep_total)

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
summary(msleep$sleep_total)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
quantile(msleep$sleep_total, probs = .75)
```

::: notes

The third quartile IS the 75th percentile

- Here I'm also showing you the function to calculate ANY percentile

<br>

Interpret this result for me

**What does this 13.75 mean?**

<br>

**So, which animals do you come closest to in sleep terms?**

:::





## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**How much better is the fuel economy of cars driving on the highway versus driving in the city?**

(Built-in Data: mpg, Variables: cty, hwy)

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mpg$cty)
sd(mpg$cty)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mpg$hwy)
sd(mpg$hwy)
```

::: notes

**So, what's your answer to this question?**

<br>

**Which comparison is the "right" one? Why?**

Here's an example of a descriptive statistics table from Hultman, Kathman and Shannon (2016).

- These tables are often key to understanding any quantitative research paper

<br>

Since you don't have direct access to the data, this is your chance to "see" the data through the summary statistics

- This tells us the average score for each variable and the standard deviation around it, PLUS

- The range tells us the extreme of each variable in the cases in this sample 

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's now build a descriptive statistics table!

*Read slide*

<br>

You'll basically use two functions to complete this assignment

- summary() gives you basically all you need

- sd() is the missing piece

<br>

Two pieces of code to help you complete this assignment

- **REVEAL**: FIRST, here is the code you need to count the observations in each variable that is NOT missing data

- The "d" here is what I named the dataset in R, replace that with whatever you named your dataset

- You'll see from this that some of these variables are missing A LOT of data

<br>

**REVEAL**: SECOND, most of the descriptive stats functions will return an "NA" if you are missing data

- This is a GOOD thing! You want to know when you have a missing data problem!

- You have to tell R to ignore the missing data to use sd() and that means you are choosing to lose some of your sample

- **Make sense?**

<br>

**Any questions on the assignment for today?**

- Let's get to work!

Canvas Assignment: Analyzing our Descriptive Statistics from the WDI

Submit a descriptive statistics table providing the N, mean, sd, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile and maximum value for each of the variables in our WDI dataset.

Use that table to answer the following questions with short arguments. While each answer may be concise, please ensure that you are fully explaining your answers to each question. 

Also, this assignment should be submitted as a pdf document to preserve your formatting of the document (in Word use "export as pdf").

1. Which variables are missing too much data, or too much of the necessary data (selection bias), for us to claim that these descriptive statistics represent variation across the world?

2. Which variable holds the most variation across the sample? In other words, which variable spreads the countries of the world out the most across its range (e.g. dispersion)?

3. According to these measures, how substantively different is life for the countries doing "worst" from those doing the "best"? Compare the countries in the bottom quartile (25th percentile) to those in the top quartile (75th percentile) across the measures and remember that some of our measures work in reverse (higher numbers are "worse").

4. Focus on the variable you selected and analyzed in Week 3. What do we learn about the world from the descriptive statistics for your variable?
