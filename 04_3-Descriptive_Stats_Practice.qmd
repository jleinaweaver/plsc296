4. How many hours per day do you have to sleep to sleep longer than 75% of studied mammals? (Built-in Data: msleep, Variable: sleep_total)

5. Which mammal sleeps the least and which the most? (Built-in Data: msleep, Variable: sleep_total)

6. What is the median number of carburetors in the `mtcars` dataset? (Built-in Data: mtcars, Variable: carb) 

7. How much better fuel economy do cars get when driving on the highway versus driving in the city? Your answer must be clear and must defend your choice of which statistics you have chosen to focus on. (Built-in Data: mpg, Variables: cty, hwy)

**How did this go?**

- **Everybody building their R skills a bit?**

<br>

**SLIDE:** Let's step through the questions

:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**What proportion of US presidents since 1953 have been Republicans?**

(Built-in Data: presidential, Variable: party)

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
proportions(table(presidential$party))
```

**Everybody get this?**

**Why are the mean and median total populations in the midwest so different from each other?**

(Built-in Data: midwest, Variable: poptotal)

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(midwest$poptotal)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sd(midwest$poptotal)
```

::: notes
**So, what's your answer to this question?**

<br>

On average, the cities in the midwest differ from the mean by nearly 300k!

- Huge variance in city sizes

- Some VERY small (sub-2k) and some MASSIVE (5+ million)

## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**How significant is the problem of poverty in the US midwest?**

(Built-in Data: midwest, Variables: percbelowpoverty, percchildbelowpovert)

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(midwest$percbelowpoverty)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(midwest$percchildbelowpovert)
```

::: notes

Depends, right?

- The poorest counties are in REALLY bad shape

- BUT, the third quartile is fairly low so 75% of counties in not terrible shape (depending on what prop you are comfortable with)

## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**How many hours per day do you have to sleep to sleep longer than 75% of studied mammals?**

(Built-in Data: msleep, Variable: sleep_total)

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
summary(msleep$sleep_total)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
quantile(msleep$sleep_total, probs = .75)
```

::: notes

The third quartile IS the 75th percentile

- Here I'm also showing you the function to calculate ANY percentile

<br>

Interpret this result for me

**What does this 13.75 mean?**

**Which mammal sleeps the least and which the most?**

(Built-in Data: msleep, Variable: sleep_total)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Identify the range and view the data
msleep |>
  select(name, sleep_total) |>
  arrange(sleep_total) |>
  slice_head(n = 10) |>
  kbl(align = c('l', 'c')) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 22)

  kbl(align = c('l', 'c')) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 22)

The most direct approach is probably to use the View() function and click the arrow next to sleep_total to sort the data

Per the book the median of an ordinal variable is where the cumulative sum crosses the 50th percentile

Here's an example of a descriptive statistics table from Hultman, Kathman and Shannon (2016).

- These tables are often key to understanding any quantitative research paper

<br>

Since you don't have direct access to the data, this is your chance to "see" the data through the summary statistics

- This tells us the average score for each variable and the standard deviation around it, PLUS

- The range tells us the extreme of each variable in the cases in this sample 

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's now build a descriptive statistics table!

**Create a descriptive stats table for our WDI data**

- Columns: N, Mean, SD, Min, 25th, Median, 75th, Max

- Rows: WDI variables

**Calculate the "N" (the observations NOT missing data):**

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
colSums(!is.na(d))
```

::: notes

*Read slide*

<br>

You'll basically use two functions to complete this assignment

- summary() gives you basically all you need

- sd() is the missing piece

<br>

Here's one bit of extra R code to make things easier

- **REVEAL**: FIRST, here is the code you need to count the observations in each variable that is NOT missing data

- The "d" here is what I named the dataset in R, replace that with whatever you named your dataset

- You'll see from this that some of these variables are missing A LOT of data

<br>

**Any questions on the assignment for today?**

- Let's get to work!

Canvas Assignment: Analyzing our Descriptive Statistics from the WDI

Submit a descriptive statistics table providing the N, mean, sd, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile and maximum value for each of the variables in our WDI dataset.

Use that table to answer the following questions with short arguments. While each answer may be concise, please ensure that you are fully explaining your answers to each question. Also, this assignment should be submitted as a pdf document to preserve your formatting of the document (in Word use "export as pdf").

1. Which variables are missing too much data, or too much of the necessary data (selection bias), for us to claim that these descriptive statistics represent variation across the world?

2. Which variable is the most positively skewed? What does that mean in real world terms?

3. Which variable is the most negatively skewed? What does that mean in real world terms?

4. Which variable holds the most variation across the sample (e.g. countries most dispersed across its values)?

5. How substantively different is life in the bottom quartile countries (25th percentile) from those in the top quartile (75th percentile)?
