Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions (especially to make sure they successfully installed R and RStudio)

2. BEFORE CLASS change eval=FALSE to TRUE for final run of slides to include animation

3. Add FH data and R file from Posit Cloud exercise (class 2-1) to Canvas Modules for today

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's finish setting up RStudio

:::



## Setting Up the Software {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Open RStudio

2. In the console (bottom-left window) run:

:::

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readxl")

install.packages("tidyverse")
```

::: notes

**Is everybody up and running with RStudio on their laptops?**

<br>

Last set-up piece is to install the two extra packages we've been using on the Cloud so far

- Let us know if you get stuck with this!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Why are we doing all this computer stuff?

::: notes

This semester we learn to code!

<br>

1) Learning to code means learning to break down complicated tasks into simple steps

- You'll be amazed by how much you can accomplish once you learn some very basic code.

- This process will almost certainly begin to make impacts in the rest of your life too!

<br>

2) Learning to code means learning to do science in transparent and replicatable ways

- Doing analyses in code means having a written record of every step you took in your process

- Other scientists can check your work or build on top of it!

- You can return to these notes and steps in the future (Senior Seminar) and extract exactly what you need to do new things!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Learning to code is absolutely a CV item

::: notes

No matter what career you end up pursuing, you will benefit from being:

1. More comfortable using a computer,

2. A better problem-solver, and

3. Having developed better habits in note taking and transparency

<br>

So, why are we learning R?

1. It is free,

2. it is cross-platform, 

3. it is cutting-edge, and

4. it is WIDELY used by companies across the world.

Along the way this semester we'll pepper in some fun approaches to using animation to create more dynamic visualizations

- A great tool for presentations and reports that live on the web

![](Images/03_3-R_Engine.png)

::: notes

Key analogy: R is the engine and RStudio is the fancy dashboard we use to drive the car

- When you open RStudio, you are opening R!

- RStudio just makes it much, much easier to work with R to get things done.

<br>

You can absolutely do everything in R without RStudio.

- You cannot use RStudio without having R.

<br>

So, this semester you are learning to code in R but we'll be working in RStudio.

### Make sense?

## Organize your Semester {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Data and Notes**

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Include:

- A top-level folder for the class, and

- A folder for different units in class

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: notes

I'm going to ask everyone to adopt this file organization structure for the semester.

- ALL code we write will assume this is where your files and data live.

<br>

**Questions on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Cloud backup is REQUIRED

:::



## Organize your Semester {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**You MUST backup your files online!**

<br>

![](Images/04_1-cloud-storage.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

<br>

OneDrive is part of Office 365: 

https://www.drury.edu/tech-services/computer-software/

::: notes

Cloud backups of your files in this class is a REQUIREMENT in the syllabus

- You are REQUIRED to back up all of your files to a cloud service after EVERY class

- I will not accept lost files or broken computers as acceptable excuses for incomplete records and missed deadlines.

<br>

I don't care which backup service you use

- Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, etc

<br>

Important note: OneDrive is FREE for Drury students as part of your Office 365 subscription!


<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, let's test your setup

:::



## Test your setup {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. Create a new folder: Freedom House

2. Download the files from Canvas

    - Freedom_House_Data-2025.xlsx
    - Analyzing Freedom House Data.R

3. Double-click the R file to open RStudio

4. Run all the code in the file

**Option 2**

![](Images/03_3-New_Script.png)

:::
::::

::: notes

A "script" file is a handy method for creating notes or building a data project in R.

<br>

Two options shown here.

- Create the new script and then save it with the filename "Getting_Started."

- It will add the ".R" automatically.

<br>

In future, anytime you double-click to open a .R file it should open it directly in RStudio.

::: notes

R is an insanely overpowered calculator.

<br>

Everybody copy down these notes.

- Feel free to swap in whatever numbers you want.

<br>

Notice the color difference between lines that are code and lines with a hash that are comments or notes

  "x <= y", "Less or equal to", 
  "x > y", "Greater than", 
  "x >= y", "Greater or equal to",
  "x == y", "Equal to",
  "x != y", "Not equal to"
  ) |>

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Less than
22 < 234

# Greater than
67 > 5366

# Equal to
7 == 32

# Not equal to
7 != 32
```

::: notes

You'll also find R is very good at comparing values.

- I understand this looks abstract, but I assure you this is a very important element in statistics AND programming.

<br>

Everybody copy these down and take a minute to practice running these comparisons.

- Feel free to change the numbers to anything you want.

- The results should all be TRUE or FALSE

<br>

Important for your notes, checking if two values are EQUAL requires TWO equals signs.

- One equals sign works like the arrow we use to save a value

- Two equals signs ask the question "are these two values the same"?

<br>

### Everybody doing ok?

## Using R for Vectors of Data {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Save a list of numbers as the object 'x1'
x1 <- c(64, 57, 52, 58, 67)

# Print the numbers in the object
x1

# Do math on the vector
x1 + 10
x1 * 3

# Check relationships on the vector
x1 > 56
```

::: notes

One of the remarkably powerful uses of R is that it will let you save lists of numbers (e.g. data) using a named object.

<br>

Imagine 'x1' here is a single variable describing the heights in inches for five people.

- Once you save the heights as an object you can now do calculations on all of the heights at once!

<br>

**Make sense?**

<br>

Copy all this down and make sure you can run the code.

**Univariate Analyses: Levels of Measurement**

- Nominal variables

- Ordinal variables

- Interval-level variables

    - Discrete or Continuous

:::

::: notes

For today I had you read an excerpt from Chapter 2 of the textbook that discusses variables by their level of measurement

- **Any questions on the three main types of variable discussed there?**

<br>

**Out of curiosity, and if the goal is to describe the world accurately, which level of measurement is best?**

- (It depends!)

- Our preference is as much precision as possible (e.g. interval)

- But some things cannot be measured with a great deal of precision.

<br>

**Per your Canvas submissions, what's an example of a nominal variable from one of our datasets so far this semester?**

<br>

**And an example of an ordinal variable?**

<br>

**And an example of an interval-level variable?**

- **Is that continuous or discrete?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next class

<br>

*Chapter Notes*

Nominal-Level Variables 

- Nominal variables are the least precise.
- A nominal-level variable communicates differences between units of analysis on the characteristics being measured.
- The values are mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive. 
- Some nominal variables are binary.
- Gender is a good example

Ordinal-Level Variables

- Variables measured at the ordinal level may be rank ordered. That is, someone or something may have more or less of the characteristic being measured by the variable.  
- Think about the level of education individuals have completed. One may have completed an advanced graduate degree while another may have dropped out of high school. The one with the graduate degree has more education than the one who dropped out of high school.

Interval-Level Variables

- Interval-level variables provide precise measurements of a characteristic, such as age or income, or any other characteristic, which can be measured along a continuous spectrum.
- Some interval-level variables have discrete values or continuous values. 
    - Discrete values usually count the number of times something has occurred.
    - Continuous values can have an infinite number of unique values and can be precisely estimated with decimal places
