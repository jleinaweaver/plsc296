![](Images/01_1-learn_code.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

This semester we learn to code!

<br>

1) Learning to code means learning to break down complicated tasks into simple steps

- You'll be amazed by how much you can accomplish once you learn some very basic code.

- This process will almost certainly begin to make impacts in the rest of your life too!

<br>

2) Learning to code means learning to do science in transparent and replicatable ways

- Doing analyses in code means having a written record of every step you took in your process

- Other scientists can check your work or build on top of it!

- You can return to these notes and steps in the future (Senior Seminar) and extract exactly what you need to do new things!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Learning to code is absolutely a CV item

:::

![](Images/01_1-companies_using_R.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

No matter what career you end up pursuing, you will benefit from being:

1. More comfortable using a computer,

2. A better problem-solver, and

3. Having developed better habits in note taking and transparency

<br>

So, why are we learning R?

1. It is free,

2. it is cross-platform, 

3. it is cutting-edge, and

4. it is WIDELY used by companies across the world.

## You will make animated plots! {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.4, out.width='100%', fig.width=8, eval=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(gganimate)
library(gapminder)

gapminder |>
  filter(continent != "Oceania") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, ncol = 4) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(3, 13)) +
  transition_time(year) + #<<
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = "GDP per capita (log 10)", y = "Life Expectancy") 
```

::: notes

Along the way this semester we'll pepper in some fun approaches to using animation to create more dynamic visualizations

- A great tool for presentations and reports that live on the web

::: notes

I know it seems weird that I've asked you to install two pieces of software to use just one of them

- **SLIDE**: Why are we doing this?

:::

## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/03_3-R_Engine.png)

::: notes

Key analogy: R is the engine and RStudio is the fancy dashboard we use to drive the car

- When you open RStudio, you are opening R!

- RStudio just makes it much, much easier to work with R to get things done.

<br>

You can absolutely do everything in R without RStudio.

- You cannot use RStudio without having R.

<br>

So, this semester you are learning to code in R but we'll be working in RStudio.

### Make sense?

:::

## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/03_3-rstudio_blank.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes
**Does everybody have RStudio open?**

- It should look something like this.

<br>

By default, RStudio uses a four pane layout but we'll spend most of our time using two of them.

<br>

To start I want us to make a bunch of configuration changes that I think will make your life easier.

- I will post today's slides on Canvas for future reference

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

<br>

Open RStudio

- "Tools" &rarr; "Global Options"

- "General": Uncheck all

![](Images/02_1-global_options1.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=0 width="540"}

::: notes

Let's go into the options!

<br>

Unchecking all the boxes here tells RStudio we want to start from scratch whenever we open the program

- Good practice for doing science
    - You need to keep yourself rooted in good file organization practices, no shortcuts!

- Even better practice when working in a computer lab!

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

<br>

"Code" page

- &#10004; soft-wrap R source files

![](Images/02_1-global_options2.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=0 width="540"}

::: notes

Wraps the text in your code to make it easier to read.

- Trust me.

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

<br>

"Pane Layout" page

- Top-right: "Console"

![](Images/02_1-global_options3.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=0 width="540"}

::: notes

Using the four drop-down windows you can reorganize the layout of the windows.

- I'd like you to start with this change so we can keep our notes side-by-side with the R Console.

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

<br>

"Rmarkdown" page

- Uncheck "Show output..."

![](Images/02_1-global_options4.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=0 width="540"}

::: notes

Another option RStudio is doing to try and help you that I think is annoying.

- Keep the code output in the console, not mixed into your notes.

- Again, trust me for now, feel free to change it later when you get comfortable

## Organize your Semester {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Data and Notes**

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Include:

- A top-level folder for the class,

- A folder for the data,

- A folder for class notes, and

- A folder for each report
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](Images/02_1-Folders.png)

:::
::::

::: notes

I'm going to ask everyone to adopt this file organization structure for the semester.

- ALL code we write will assume this is where your files and data live.

### Questions on this?

<br>

These notes and data CANNOT live on the lab computer.

- These computers get wiped and refreshed from time-to-time to keep them running well.

- DON'T lose your data because of this!

<br>

My advice, if you're going to work on the lab computers.

- Set up this folder structure on a usb key, AND

- At the end of every class upload the changes to your cloud account (OneDrive)

<br>

REMEMBER, lost data/notes/reports due to poor data practices are on you!

<br>

### Any questions on the set-up / configuration stuff we've covered so far?

Ok, let's make some stuff!

:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Create a script file: "Getting Started.R"**
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Option 1**

"File" 

&#8595;

"New File" 

&#8595;

"R Script"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Option 2**

![](Images/03_3-New_Script.png)

:::
::::

::: notes

A "script" file is a handy method for creating notes or building a data project in R.

<br>

Two options shown here.

- Create the new script and then save it with the filename "Getting_Started."

- It will add the ".R" automatically.

<br>

In future, anytime you double-click to open a .R file it should open it directly in RStudio.

:::

## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/03_3-RStudio_Practice1.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Hopefully, everybody is now looking at an RStudio screen like this.

- My apologies that on the slide the file is labeled "Practice.R" instead of the "Getting Started.R"

<br>

And remember, you write your notes on the left and the R console produces stuff on the right

<br>

My request is that you create a new script file for each day of class and use that to take notes and practice code.

- Don't just keep adding onto the same one, it can get unwieldy.

:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/03_3-RStudio_Practice2.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

You can take notes in an R script (and you SHOULD!) using the hash symbol.

- Each line you want to write that is NOT R code must start with a hash.

<br>

Get in the habit of annotating your code!

- Every time you write a line of code to do something add a note above it telling you what it does

- This is an invaluable habit!

<br>

Remember, each day's notes (e.g. script file) are a resource for you going forward.

- Your work in class is designed to help you create a record of all the skills we will learn that you may want to use in Senior Seminar!

- So, label your script files so you know where to go in future when you need something specific

<br>

For example, next week we will use code to calculate descriptive statistics.

- e.g. mean, median, percentiles, IQRs, SD, etc

- I will suggest you label your notes file for that class as "Descriptive statistics"!

<br>

### Make sense?

:::

## Using R as a Calculator {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
tribble(
  ~Function, ~Description,
  "x + y", "Addition",
  "x - y", "Subtraction",
  "x * y", "Multiplication",
  "x / y", "Division",
  "x ^ y", "Exponentiation"
) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(align = c("c", "l"))
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Addition & subtraction
151 + 13 - 224

# Division
831/12

# Exponentiation
5^12

# Multiplication, 
# division and parentheses
312 * (23/154)
```
:::
::::

::: notes

R is an insanely overpowered calculator.

<br>

Everybody copy down these notes.
- Feel free to swap in whatever numbers you want.

<br>

Notice the color difference between lines that are code and lines with a hash that are comments or notes
:::



## Running your Code {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

![](Images/03_3-Run_Selected_Lines.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

- **Option 1:** Cursor on line 740, Ctrl-Enter

- **Option 2:** Use the "Run" menu


::: notes

Let's get our answers!

- Each of these lines IS programming code! Congrats!

<br>

We need to send your code to the console so R can "run" it.

<br>

Option 1: Put your mouse cursor on the line you want to run and press Ctrl-Enter

<br>

Option 2: Click the first line on the 'Run' menu.

<br>

Everybody take a minute to practice running the code you've written

:::


## Using R for simple relationships {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
```{r}
tribble(
  ~Function, ~Description,
  "x < y", "Less than",
  "x <= y", "Less or equal to", 
  "x > y", "Greater than", 
  "x >= y", "Greater or equal to",
  "x == y", "Equal to",
  "x != y", "Not equal to"
  ) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(align = c("c", "l"))
```
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Less than
22 < 234

# Greater than
67 > 5366

# Equal to
7 == 32

# Not equal to
7 != 32
```
:::
::::

::: notes

You'll also find R is very good at comparing values.

- I understand this looks abstract, but I assure you this is a very important element in statistics AND programming.

<br>

Everybody copy these down and take a minute to practice running these comparisons.

- Feel free to change the numbers to anything you want.

- The results should all be TRUE or FALSE

<br>

Important for your notes, checking if two values are EQUAL requires TWO equals signs.

- One equals sign works like the arrow we use to save a value

- Two equals signs ask the question "are these two values the same"?

<br>

### Everybody doing ok?

:::


## Using R for Vectors of Data {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Save a list of numbers as the object 'x1'
x1 <- c(64, 57, 52, 58, 67)

# Print the numbers in the object
x1

# Do math on the vector
x1 + 10
x1 * 3

# Check relationships on the vector
x1 > 56
```

::: notes

One of the remarkably powerful uses of R is that it will let you save lists of numbers (e.g. data) using a named object.

<br>

Imagine 'x1' here is a single variable describing the heights in inches for five people.

- Once you save the heights as an object you can now do calculations on all of the heights at once!

<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

Copy all this down and make sure you can run the code.
:::



## Installing Extra Packages {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Install packages with extra tools

# Readxl let's you input Excel files into R
install.packages("readxl")

# Tidyverse makes tons of statistics work easier
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

::: notes

One more configuration step, we need to install two packages.

- Packages are collections of extra features that you can add to R when you need them.

<br>

After a new install of R, we need to do each of these one time. Unless you update R you won't have to install these again.

- We'll start using these Friday.

<br>

Run each of these lines and let me know when they are done.

## 2. Tidy your data before exploring it {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

![](Images/01_2-tidy.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes
**How did the data cleaning / tidying exercise go?**

<br>

Let's see what you made!

- Everybody open their tidied data and let's walk around to see!

<br>

**SLIDE**: My version

:::



## The World Press Freedom Index {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/03_2-World_Press2024.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Easy case for us today!

- The current year is basically tidy

<br>

*IF CLEANING WAS REQUIRED*

Here's my version focused on the most recent observations only.

- I'll post this on Canvas so we can all work off the same copy of the data.

<br>

I also pulled all of the data from the website to cover the last ten years and is posted on Canvas as well.

<br>

This is a MUCH longer datasheet, but that doesn't matter to R!

- Over 1,800 rows of data

- **SLIDE**: Programming is awesome for data science

2. Johnson (2012) p361-376

3. Play with R / RStudio!
:::

::: notes

Monday we start doing statistics in R!

- Two readings to get you ready to work.

<br>

Also, take some time to explore and play with the software

- The faster you get comfortable with it, the more powerful you become!
