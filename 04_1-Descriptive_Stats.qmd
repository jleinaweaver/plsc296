# Our Research Project {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png"}

-   Report 1: Analyze the Outcome Variable(s)

-   Report 2: Analyze the Predictor Variable(s)

-   Report 3: Bivariate Test of your Hypotheses

-   Report 4: Multivariate Test of your Hypotheses

::: notes
Our project this semester builds up, as all good projects must, in an iterative fashion.

-   We begin by analyzing variables on their own, then together

This iterative process allows us to learn the coding and statistics we need in a slow, deliberate fashion.

-   So, lots of time to boost our confidence in the tools and to practice applying and interpreting them.

<br>

**SLIDE**: To complete the first two reports you will need a set of skills we refer to as univariate analyses
:::

## Univariate Analyses {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

1.  Descriptive Statistics
    -   Counts, Proportions, Means, Medians, Standard Deviations, Percentiles, Ranges and Interquartile Ranges (IQR)
2.  Visualizations
    -   Bar plots, histograms, box plots and line plots

::: notes
A univariate analysis is one that focuses on a single variable on its own

<br>

Over the next week these are the tools we'll be learning to code and interpret.

-   This is the complete list of things I will expect to see you use and explain on the first two reports.

<br>

Write these down!

-   Use this like a checklist for yourself as we go

-   Over the next week you should make sure you understand how to make each of these in R and how to interpret their results

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, so why do we need univariate analyses?
:::


## What do we do with data? {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(543)
d <- round(runif(265, 100, 250), 0)
d
```

::: notes
Imagine you had collected all of this data - This could be dollars, pounds, degrees, anything.

<br>

As a simple list this is an overwhelming amount of information for anyone to read let alone understand.

<br>

Univariate analyses refer to a series of tools that allow you to summarize a big list of data points into something more digestible - What is the middle of this collection? - e.g. an average

-   How much does the data vary around the middle?
    -   e.g. Is everybody close to or far away from the average?
-   What is the smallest and largest number in the data?
    -   e.g. What are the top and bottom numbers that wrap around all the data?

<br>

So, if these were a list of house prices in SGF it would be super useful to know: - What is the cheapest and most expensive house?

-   How much is the average house?

-   Are most houses close to the average or spread out across the whole range?

<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

**SLIDE**: The key here is to realize that THIS is the problem statistics was invented to solve!
:::

# Defining Statistics {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png"}

<br>

**Level 1**

Statistics is a set of tools we use to summarize data

Summarize: "give a brief statement of the main points of (something)" (Oxford Dictionary).

::: notes
*READ SLIDE*

<br>

Now, don't get me wrong, we learn a TON from basic description and summary, but we also have bigger ambitions!
:::

# Defining Statistics {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png"}

<br>

**Level 2**

"The practice or science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of **inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample**" (Oxford Dictionary).

::: notes
In simpler terms, statistics also gives us the tools to learn things about an entire population based only on the summaries of data from a sample of that population.

-   e.g. This survey of 2,300 Americans tells us how popular Pres Biden is...

<br>

So, those are the big, initial goals.

-   The takeaway is that univariate analyses and descriptive statistics, even if they seem simple, can be INCREDIBLY powerful tools for learning about the world.

Let's set off on the right foot!

-   Create a new script file for your notes today and label it descriptive statistics.

<br>

Last week we used R as a calculator on single numbers and on a vector of numbers.

-   Starting today we'll be using R to work with data, but the logic of taking notes and writing code work the exact same

-   If you get confused, don't forget the Healy reading from Friday walks you through the way R does things and why we use functions!

  kableExtra::column_spec(1:6, background = "white")
```

::: notes
R includes a number of built-in data sets for practice.

-   Each extra package tends to bring more practice data as well.

<br>

The "mpg" data set is provided as part of an extra package.

-   "This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data that the EPA makes available on https://fueleconomy.gov/."

-   'mpg' has data on 234 cars (observations) across 11 variables

<br>

**SLIDE**: To access the data set...
:::

##  {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)

# View the data in the console
mpg

# View the data in a spreadsheet
View(mpg)

# List the variables in the data set
names(mpg)

# Access any single variable using '$'
mpg$manufacturer
```

::: notes
Everybody copy these notes (with a #) and make sure you can run each piece of code.

-   You will primarily write code in R to either input data or apply functions to that data.

-   As you see here, functions are a word (or words) followed by parentheses.

<br>

### Did it all work for you?

<br>

Relevant notes from Healy:

1.  R is essentially a collection of functions each of which lets you do something useful using data
    -   View() means show me the data in a spreadsheet
    -   names() means tell me what variables are in this dataset
2.  R is case sensitive so you have to write the code EXACTLY
    -   the "V" in view is capitalized
3.  We can use \$ to access a single variable at a time in a dataset
:::

## 3. Variable type determines the tool {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_2-levels_measurement.png")
```

::: notes
Now, as we start calculating descriptive statistics don't forget our third principle of data analysis

-   Variable Type Determines Tool

-   Today we start applying this insight
:::

## 3. Variable type determines the tool {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mpg$manufacturer
```

::: notes
We'll start by summarizing or describing categorical variables

<br>

When you ask R to show you a single variable with "$" it will provide all the observations in a list.

- The numbers in brackets on the side is which number observation starts that row

<br>

### Refresh my memory, why is manufacturer a categorical variable?

-   (e.g. those with observations defined as categories or levels)

<br>

The mpg dataset has the manufacturer information for 234 cars

-   That's a rather hard to digest list

<br>

### Per your readings for today, how do we summarize or describe this categorical variable?

-   (Categorical variables can be summarized as either counts or proportions.)

-   e.g. make a table of counts or proportions

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's do those things in R!
:::

## If you have a categorical variable... {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png"}

**1. Count the levels with table()**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
table(mpg$manufacturer)
```

**2. Convert to proportions with proportions()**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
proportions(table(mpg$manufacturer))
```

::: notes
### Everybody got the code written down and working?

<br>

Our first line of code uses the table function to count the levels in the variable

<br>

Our second line uses a function on a function - Basically the input for proportions is the result of the table function

<br>

### Questions? Got it working?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's practice!
:::




## What proportion of cars in `mpg` are four-wheel drive (`drv`)? {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Count the levels in `drv` and convert to proportions

```{r, echo=TRUE}
proportions(table(mpg$drv))
```
:::

::: notes
Use the code we just wrote to answer this question

-   Same dataset, just focus on a different categorical variable.

<br>

*Show Results*: That's all there is to it.

-   Descriptive stats on categorical variables is super easy.

-   Count the levels and, optionally, convert the count to a proportion

<br>

It looks like very few of the "popular" cars in this dataset from 1999 - 2008 were rear-wheel drive.
:::


## 3. Variable type determines the tool  {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mpg$cty
```

::: notes

Now, what if you'd like to summarize a numeric variable instead of a categorical one?

-   Let's go back to our third principle again!

<br>

### Why can't we use the same tools (tables) we just used for categorical variables?

-   (Long numeric variables will have tons and tons of different values which, in a table, would require a massive number of columns)

-   Not much simpler than just reviewing the data

<br>

**SLIDE**: As you saw in the reading, we have lots of good options for summarizing numeric variables.
:::



## If you have a numerical variable... {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

**Measures of Central Tendency**

<br>

**1. Find the average value with mean()**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(mpg$cty)
```

<br>

**2. Find the median value with median()**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
median(mpg$cty)
```

::: notes

Let's find the middle!

### Everybody got the code written down and working?

<br>

Let's make sure the intuition is clear.

### Per the reading, what's the difference between the median and the mean?

<br>

### And what do we learn about a numeric variable if the mean and the median are very close to each other?

-   (No big outliers!)
:::




## What is the "middle" highway fuel economy (`hwy`) in `mpg`? {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
1. Find the average with mean() 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(mpg$hwy)
```

2. Find the median value with median()
```{r, echo=TRUE}
median(mpg$hwy)
```
:::

::: notes
So, you can summarize a data distribution with the mean or median as its middle, BUT

-   How do we know if the "middle" is a good summary?

-   **SLIDE**: We need to check the spread of the data!
:::



## If you have a numerical variable... {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

**Measures of the Spread**

<br>

**Use summary() for a selection of descriptive stats**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mpg$cty)
```

<br>

**Use sd() for the standard deviation**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
sd(mpg$cty)
```

::: notes

Everybody write down the code and make sure it works.

<br>

Let's talk about what summary() gives you from the outside in

-   On the ends the summary output gives you the minimum and maximum values
    -   e.g. the range
-   Next comes the 25th and 75th percentiles
    -   e.g. the IQR or middle 50%
-   The middle two values are two measures of the "middle"

<br>

The only fairly standard thing summary() doesn't give you is the std dev

<br>

### Any questions on these descriptive stats covered in the reading?

<br>

#### Notes

*If they ask about percentiles* - The most common definition of a percentile is a number where a certain percentage of scores fall below that number. - In statistics, a k-th percentile (percentile score or centile) is a score below which a given percentage k of scores in its frequency distribution falls (exclusive definition) or a score at or below which a given percentage falls (inclusive definition).

*If they ask about Std Dev*: - Hopefully building visualizations in our next two classes will help make this concept clearer! - Long story short, a measure of how far each data point is from the average...

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='20%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/04-1-Std_Dev_Formula.svg")
```

:::



## What is the earliest and latest `year` in the `mpg` dataset? {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Summarize
```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mpg$year)
```

Minimum
```{r, echo=TRUE}
min(mpg$year)
```

Maximum
```{r, echo=TRUE}
max(mpg$year)
```
:::

::: notes
Practice time!

I'm also using this as a chance to show you the functions for calculating the minimum or maximum alone.
:::



## Is it more useful to summarize the number of engine cylinders (`cyl`) as a table() or with summary()? {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Treat as a numeric variable
```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mpg$cyl)
```

Treat as a categorical variable
```{r, echo=TRUE}
table(mpg$cyl)
```
:::

::: notes
One more quick hit practice!

-   Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between a numeric and a categorical variable with levels represented by numbers!

-   Make both and tell me which you would use in a report meant to describe the distribution of cars

<br>

### What conclusion do you draw from these statistics?

<br>

The table makes clear that most cars are 4, 6 or 8 cylinders and the distribution is quite even across them (in this dataset)

-   Measures of the "middle" in a sense misrepresent these categories

-   The "average" of a Ford F150 and Kia Sorento doesn't really mean what we might think it does

<br>

The lesson: Sometimes categorical variables use numbers!

-   Be careful.
