<br>

**Does a free press promote better environmental quality around the world?**

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height=2}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Press\nFreedom", "Environmental\nQuality")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.85, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```


::: notes

As we build toward answering our research question with data we will need to pick up some new concepts and tools!

- New concepts: Probability and correlation

- New tools: Bivariate descriptive statistics

<br>

**Everybody ready to go with a new script file?**

- I would suggest you put "bivariate analyses" in the name so its easy to find in future!

::: notes
I'd love to play with more exciting data today and Wednesday, but because we are building your notes for the future I want to use built-in data

- This way, in future, the code should always work

- If we explored external datasets then you'd need the code PLUS the dataset in order to refresh your memory with these notes

<br>

To refresh our memories, the `mpg` dataset is part of the tidyverse package

- The data was produced by the EPA and tracks fuel economy data for 38 popular models of cars in  1999 and 2008.

<br>

The Variables

- Displacement is a proxy for engine size
- Number of cylinders
- Type of transmission
- Type of drive train
- city and highway fuel economy
:::


## 3. Variable type determines the tool {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_2-levels_measurement.png")
```

::: notes
Just as we did previously, we will be guided in learning our new tools by this rule of data science!

- If you know the variable types you are analyzing, choosing the right tool is done for you!

Analysis of the relationship between two categorical variables

<br>

**Remind me, what is the only thing we can do to summarize a categorical variable?**

- (Count the levels!)

<br>

**And what is the function that does that for us?**

- (table!)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's now extend the table function to count the levels in TWO categorical variables

:::

:::
::::

::: notes
Adding a second variable to the table function is quite simple

- On the left we see that 58 cars are manual transmission with five gears

- On the right we see how that 58 cars is distributed across the different drive trains

<br>

This is what we refer to as a cross-tabulation or cross-tab

- **Make sense?**

<br>

**Which combinations of transmission and drive train are the most common in this data set?**

<br>

**Remind me again, how do we convert a table of counts into a table of proportions?**

- (**SLIDE**: proportions())

**SLIDE**: Practice
:::




## Bivariate Analyses {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Categorical x Categorical**

<br>

What **proportion** of SUVs (`class`) are four wheel drive (`drv`)?

::: notes
Alright, use these tools to answer this question!
:::



## Bivariate Analyses {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Categorical x Categorical**

<br>

What **proportion** of SUVs (`class`) are four wheel drive (`drv`)?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
proportions(table(mpg$class, mpg$drv))
```

::: notes
**Ok, why is the answer to my question definitely not 22%?**

- (These are proportions OVERALL)

- (e.g. 22% of ALL the cars in the mpg dataset are 4wd SUVs)

<br>

**SLIDE**: What we want is for R to calculate proportions separately for each class of cars.
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Proportions by Row
proportions(table(mpg$class, mpg$drv), margin = 1)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Proportions by Column
proportions(table(mpg$class, mpg$drv), margin = 2)
```

::: notes

The 'margin' argument let's you recalculate proportions by either the rows or the columns

<br>

Row margins means each class of car is estimated separately

- 82% of SUVs in the sample are 4wd

- 100% minivans are front wheel drive

<br>

Column margins means each drive train type is estimated separately

- 50% of 4wd cars are SUVs

- Most front weel drive cars are compact (33%), midsize (36%) or subcompact (21%)

<br>

**Any questions on using table and proportions to perform bivariate analyses on two categorical variables?**

- Sometimes you want proportions overall and sometimes you'll want proportions across categories

- Either case, the code is simple!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's tie this to the Wheelan chapter on probability you read for class today.
:::



## "Probability is the study of events and outcomes involving an element of uncertainty" {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/08_2-probability.jpg")
```

<br>

Source: Wheelan (2014), 71

::: notes
Wheelan defines "probability" as "the study of events and outcomes involving an element of uncertainty"

<br>

**Any big picture questions on the material in the Wheelan chapter before we use it?**
:::


## "Probability is the study of events and outcomes involving an element of uncertainty" {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Proportions by Row
proportions(table(mpg$class, mpg$drv), margin = 1)
```

::: notes

**How confident should we be in using these proportions as estimates of the "true" probabilities?**

- **In other words, how confident are you that 83% of the SUVs on the roads today are 4wd?**

<br>

`mpg` dataset...

- Only includes a sample from two years: 1999 and 2008

- We have no idea how the researchers chose these specific models: 38 "popular" cars

- We have no idea how the EPA chose the cars to study here

<br>

I hope this is helping to reinforce a REALLY important idea for us

- The tools of statistics are frequently used to help us estimate real-world probabilities using things like proportions in a dataset

- HOWEVER, without understanding the measures in our data we really can't say anything about how they represent the probabilities

- BUT, once we understand the measures we CAN say something useful about probability (with uncertainty attached)

<br>

In short, our datasets are a representation of the wider world (the population)

- Only by analyzing where the data came from and pairing that with statistics can we say anything useful about the real world.

<br>

**Any questions on this?**

Now let's shift to bivariate analysis of the relationship between a single categorical and a single numeric variable.

<br>

**Remind me, how do we summarize a categorical variable like drive train?**

- (Count the levels with table)

<br>

**And how do we calculate the descriptive statistics for a single numeric variable like city fuel economy?**

- (The summary function!)

<br>

Let's now learn to combine these two approaches

- **SLIDE**: Using our `mpg` dataset we can ask, do cars with different drive trains have different levels of fuel efficiency?

The Aggregate Function

- aggregate(data, y ~ x, FUN)
:::
:::
::::

::: notes

We'll use the aggregate function to calculate the bivariate version of descriptive statistics

<br>

The aggregate function looks a little different from what we've done so far

- The "data" argument you've seen before

- The "y tilde x" argument is what R refers to as a formula
    - "y" is the NUMERIC outcome you are trying to summarize
    - "x" is the CATEGORICAL predictor
    
- FUN is the argument where you specify a function to apply to the Y variable
    - e.g. summary, sd, mean, median, min, max, etc
    
<br>

::: notes
Now we shift to bivariate analysis of the relationship between two numeric variables.

<br>

For this challenge you will have two options to consider 

- **SLIDE**: Let me introduce the first one as the solution to a puzzle

:::



## Bivariate Analyses {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Numeric x Numeric**

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
aggregate(data = mpg, cty ~ displ, FUN = summary)
```

::: notes

What I'd like to know is how city fuel economy varies by the size of a car's engine.

- **Is this a useful answer to my question? Why or why not?**

<br>

Do not calculate descriptive statistics using two numeric variables like this.

<br>

This table presents the ILLUSION of useful information!

- Comparing these rows seems easy, but the meaning of these summaries vary A TON!

- Each row is built using a different number of cars and the differences are huge

- The 1.9 liter engine row includes ONLY three cars whereas the 2 liter engine row includes 21!

- The meaning of an average of three observations is NOT the same as one on 21 observations

<br>

The key here to remember is that doing statistics without understanding what you are producing is SUPER dangerous!

- R will give you the summary you ask for, but YOU have to know what you are asking for and when it is useful and when it isn't

<br>

Ok, let's say I do want to examine this relationship between fuel economy and engine size

- **What could I do to the `displ` variable to ensure more equal sized groups of cars?**

<br>

Remember how we solved this problem when drawing a histogram by hand!

- We created bins to each hold similar values in each bar

- **SLIDE**: Let's try that approach here!
:::



## Bivariate Analyses {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Numeric x Numeric (Convert it into Categorical)**

<br>

cut(x, breaks, labels)

- 'x' is the variable to transform

- 'breaks' lists the cut-off points for the groups

- 'labels' lists the names of the new groups

::: {.fragment}

:::: {.r-fit-text}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mpg$displ)
```

::::
:::

::: notes

Our first option for examining the relationship between two numeric variables is to convert one of them into a categorical variable!

<br>

Everybody write down the elements of the cut function

- *step through it*

- This will make more sense when you start applying it

<br>

**REVEAL**: Here we see the summary stats for engine size alone.

- To begin let's use the cut function to create a categorical version of of engine size

- To begin we'll keep it simple and make a two level categorical variable

- **SLIDE**: The code

:::


## Bivariate Analyses {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Numeric x Numeric (Convert it into Categorical)**

<br>

1. Create a new variable in `mpg`
2. Convert `displ` into `displ2`
3. Define the breaks (e.g. bins by width)
4. Label the breaks

::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mpg$displ2 <- cut(x = mpg$displ, 
                  breaks = c(0, 3.472, 8), 
                  labels = c("Small", "Large"))
```
:::

::: notes

Here's my example of adding a new engine size variable in the mpg data set.

- The cut function works a lot like the factor function we've used in ggpplot to treat numbers as words

- *Step through the code*

<br>

Breaks is the one funky bit of this code

- Here you tell R the cut points for the bins you are creating

- The bins are the spaces between each number in the list

- So I am grouping together all the cars with an engine size below the mean and all those above the mean

- **Is everybody clear on why there are three numbers in 'breaks' but only two words in 'labels'?**

<br>

Everybody run this code to create the new variable in the mpg dataset

- **Any questions on how to convert a numeric variable into a categorical variable?**

<br>

Ok, everybody now use aggregate on our new displacement variable!

- Calculate the summary statistics for city fuel economy once for small engines and once for large engines

- Go!

::: notes

Last practice of this technique

- Everybody redo this analysis but now let's transform engine size into a FOUR level categorical variable with one level per quartile

- The quartiles assure us of four groups with approximately the same number of observations in each!

- Go!

**What does this tell us about the relationship between engine size and fuel economy?**

<br>

So, your first option for calculating descriptive statistics using two numeric variables is to convert one of them into a categorical variable

- **Make sense?**
:::



## Bivariate Analyses {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**Numeric x Numeric**

  column_spec(c(3, 8), background = "pink") |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 21)
```

::: notes

Your second option is to calculate the correlation between the two numeric variables.

- **Any questions on correlations from the Wheelan chapter?**

<br>

**Per Wheelan, what are the "fabulous" advantages of correlation?**

1. Measure of linear association

2. Always between -1 and 1

3. No units attached
:::



## Correlation {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**1) A Measure of Linear Association**

<br>

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.asp = .32, fig.width = 9}
## Show correlations
cor_examples <- function(sd) {
    tibble(
    x = rnorm(50, mean = 8, sd = 2),
    y = x + rnorm(50, 0, sd),

    facet_wrap(~Group, scales = "free")
```

::: notes
The closer the value to '1', the closer the points are to the line

- **Does the intuition here make sense?**

<br>

Importantly this means correlation is not a good measure when relationships are non-linear!

- More on this in a sec!
:::




## Correlation {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**2) Always between -1 and 1**

# Show inverse correlations
inv_cor_examples <- function(sd) {
    tibble(
    x = rnorm(50, mean = 8, sd = 2),
    y = -2 * x + rnorm(50, 0, sd),

::: notes

Correlations can be either positive or negative

- Positive: Increases in X are associated with increases in Y

- Negative: Increases in X are associated with decreases in Y

<br>

The key is that as the value approaches 1 or -1 the points get closer to a line

Correlation provides a numeric representation of a linear relationship REGARDLESS of the underlying units.

<br>

Normally you have to put two things into the same scale to combine or compare them, right?

<br>

Correlation focuses on the variation not attached to the units.

Lesson: **ALWAYS** visualize your data before interpreting ANY statistic!

- Examples 2 and 3 are REALLY strong indicators of association

- Example 1 is weaker

- Example 4 is non-existent

<br>

### Make sense?

- **SLIDE**: Alright, let's calculate some correlations in R
:::


## Correlations in R {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Calculate the correlation
cor(mpg$cty, mpg$hwy)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Test the significance of the correlation (Pearsons)
cor.test(mpg$cty, mpg$hwy)
```

::: notes

Two functions to calculate correlations.

- cor() is a simple tool for calculating the correlation coefficient

- cor.test() does the same but includes confidence intervals and a significance test of the correlation.

<br>

**What do we learn about the relationship between city and highway fuel economy from these correlations?**
:::


## Practice using the `diamonds` dataset {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r}
diamonds |>
  select(price, cut, clarity, carat) |>
  slice_sample(n = 12) |>
  kbl(align = "c") |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 25)
```

::: notes
The diamonds dataset is in the tidyverse package

- It includes details on approximately 54,000 diamonds

- `price` is the dollar value of the diamond

- `cut` is the quality of the cut
    - e.g. Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal

- 'clarity' is a measurement of how clear the diamond is
    - e.g. I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)
    
- `carat` is the size of the diamond

## Analyze the relationship between: {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

1. `cut` and `clarity`

2. `cut` and `price`

3. `carat` and `price` (convert `carat` to a categorical variable)

4. `carat` and `price` (correlation)
