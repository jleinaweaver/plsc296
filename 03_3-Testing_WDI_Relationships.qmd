### Let's answer some important global questions!

::: notes

This week we have been examining a well-known and oft-utilized source of global data: The World Development Indicators made available by the World Bank

- We selected variables of interest,

- Evaluated their validity and reliability,

- Reviewed what they show about the countries in the world (in big picture), and

- Today we use that data to answer questions that will allow us to test our intuitions about the world (e.g. theory testing)

<br>

*Volunteers pitch us their question and theory*

1. *ON BOARD: You diagram their model as they explain and have the class help us fill in the assumptions*

2. *R Code: Let's see the data!*

3. *DISCUSS*: Does this data support the theory or not? 

    - Is this data valid and reliable enough for these differences to be substantive?

<br>

Everybody take a look at the assignment for next class and let me know if you have any questions!

Canvas Assignment: Getting Ready for Univariate Data Analysis

1. Read p33-39 in the Pollock and Edwards book and make sure you understand the levels of measurement (e.g. variable types)

2. Review the datasets we have worked with in class so far (Freedom House, TRIP SNAP Poll XXII and the WDI) and SUBMIT an example of a nominal, an ordinal and an interval variable from those sources. Explain why you are confident that your chosen variable is a good example of each type.

3. Install R on your personal computer/laptop (See Long and Teetor reading for a how-to on how to do this or any of the many, many other instructions on the web).  

4. AFTER installing R, install RStudio on your personal computer/laptop (See Long and Teetor reading for a how-to on how to do this or any of the many, many other instructions on the web).  

5. Submit a screenshot of RStudio running on your desktop. 

Notes

- If you get stuck in the installation process and can't solve it using the guiding documents (or a Google search) email me (jleinaweaver@drury.edu) and our TAs for help BEFORE class so we can help you (scombs003@drury.edu and jcornell@drury.edu).

- To be clear, completing Tasks 2 and 5 above will require you to submit a response to this assignment post. Please include both elements in a single response.
