### Let's answer some important global questions!

::: notes

For today I asked each of you to reflect on our World Bank data in order to generate questions we can try to answer with data.

- Specifically, by connecting two of our variables and proposing a relationship between them

<br>

My plan is to use your questions as a jumping off point into the data

- Then we can use some R code to see what the data shows

<br>

Everybody take some time to review the questions that have been submitted

- Let's pick where to start and get to work!

2. Classify all the World Bank and Freedom House variables

3. Install R and RStudio on your personal computer

Everybody take a look at the assignment for next class and let me know if you have any questions!

Canvas Assignment: Getting Ready for Univariate Data Analysis

1. Read p33-39 in the Pollock and Edwards book and then classify all of the variables we have reviewed thus far from Freedom House and the World Bank by their levels of measurement. In other words, submit three lists of variables, one for each level of measurement (e.g. nominal, ordinal and interval).

2. Install R and RStudio on your personal computer/laptop (See Long and Teetor reading for a how-to on how to do this or any of the many, many other instructions on the web).
