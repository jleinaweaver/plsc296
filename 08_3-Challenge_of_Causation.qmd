## Building a Causal Argument {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

"Causal inference refers to the process of drawing a conclusion that a specific treatment (i.e. intervention) was the 'cause' of the effect (or outcome) that was observed" (Frey 2018). 

<br>

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 6, fig.height=1.25}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Treatment", "Effect")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 2.2, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes
This week we are exploring the concepts and tools you will need to build an argument about causation using observational data.

- e.g. making an argument with data about why the world works like it does.

<br>

In other words, we need to make an argument that changes in our chosen predictors CAUSE a change in the outcome variable

<br>

**Any questions on the material from Monday before we push forward?**

Last class we proposed a hypothetical research project.

- Theory: Students in smaller classes receive more individualized attention and, therefore, experience more growth.

::: notes

The primary benefits of using random allocation are:

1. EVEN though both groups have **different people**, they will be the same **on average** in all respects.

2. SINCE the groups are the same **on average** the only difference between them is the **treatment effect**

3. SINCE the only difference between them is the treatment effect **we can use the factual outcome of each group as the counter-factual for the other group.**

**Everybody clear on why we refer to RCTs as a "gold standard" for doing science?**

::: notes
**What is the effect on our research design of moving from random allocation to allocation by nature (e.g. natural law / models)?**

- (Groups are no longer identical, on average!)

- Therefore, we CANNOT simply compare the different outcomes!

    - The outcome of the treatment group is unlikely to be a good estimate of the counterfactual for the control group

    - And vice-versa

Let's recreate our lists from Monday!

- e.g. two lists of mechanisms that could be used to explain why students might:

    - Be in large vs small class sizes, and

    - Get higher or lower scores on standardized tests.
    
<br>

*ON BOARD: Two Columns*

Class Size

- Family wealth
- Property taxes
- Better teachers
- Better schools
- Rural / Urban schools
- District zoning / size
- Student needs
- Proficiency levels vary

Success

- Family circumstances
- Time for studying
- Student Hunger / food insecurity
- Wealth
- Test anxiety
- Teaching quality
- Attention span
- Disability
- Willingness to work hard

Before we talk confounders, let's refine our understanding of these wacky arrow graphs I keep using

DAGs are incredibly useful tools for calrifying a causal argument.

Understanding confounding is much easier with this style of graphical representation for a causal argument.

::: notes
I want to give you a nontechnical definition and some examples of confounders before I show you the technical definition.

<br>

In short, a confounder is a variable that explains some of the variation in both the treatment and the outcome variables.

- In other words, the confounder causes at least some of the variation in the predictor, AND

- The confounder causes at least some of the variation in the outcome.

<br>

This is how we show a confounder in a DAG.

- Causal arrows run from the confounder variable to the predictor AND the outcome.

<br>

Two arguments required to establish a confounder:

1. The confounder MUST cause BOTH variables in the mechanism

2. The direction of effect is FROM the confounder TO the mechanism

<br>

### Questions on this?

::: notes

So, it turns out that there is a rather high correlation between ice cream sales and the number of forest fires in a given area.

<br>

Almost certainly "correlation, not causation", right?

- I don't think buying ice cream leads someone to want to start a fire.

::: notes

Ice cream sales and forest fires are correlated because they both spike in the summertime!

- Summer is confounding this mechanism.

- If you adjust your analyses to this confounder, e.g. cities in summer vs other cities in summer, the correlation is greatly reduced.

<br>

This is what we call a spurious correlation, e.g. a fake relationship

- This is also what people mean when they warn that correlation does not imply causation. 

- Confounding effects can make two unrelated variables look related!

<br>

### Does this make sense?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let me now introduce the technical definition of confounding.
:::


## Building a Causal Argument {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

**Confronting Confounding Problems**

"...any context in which the association between an outcome Y and a predictor of interest X is not the same as it would be, if we had experimentally determined the values of X" (Pearl 2000).

::: notes

This is Judea Pearl's technical definition of confounding.

- *Read slide*

- Thinking about confounding means thinking about what our data would look like if we had run this as an experiment.

<br>

Basically, with observational data we suspect our comparison groups are not identical on average, and so, we need to identify the important differences between them.

<br>

**SLIDE**: I know this is a little dense, but let's think about what this means in the context of our ice cream and arson example.
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.retina = 3, fig.align = 'center', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.65}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(1, 2, 3),
  y = c(1, 2, 1),
  labels = c("Ice Cream\n Sales", "Summer!", "Forest\n Fires")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 4), ylim = c(.75, 2.25)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = 1.5, xend = 2.5, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow()) +
  #annotate("segment", x = 1.7, xend = 1, y = 1.85, yend = 1.15, arrow = arrow()) +
  annotate("segment", x = 2.3, xend = 3, y = 1.85, yend = 1.15, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

What if we could run an RCT to test our "ice cream leads to arson" hypothesis?

- In other words, wait until summer and then control how much ice cream different cities get for sale

- Flip a coin with head's meaning a city gets a bunch of ice cream and tails meaning almost none.

<br>

The question then becomes, do we expect randomly assigned ice cream sales to impact the number of forest fires that are started?

- If we believe that removing the effect of summertime changes the results then it is a confounder in the relationship.

- So in this case we expect ice cream sales and forest fires to correlate only until we remove the effect of summertime

- Hence, summer is a confounder

<br>

Another way to think of this is as saying that a confounder is a variable that causes BOTH your predictor and your outcome to change

- Summertime causes ice cream sales to increase, and

- Summertime causes forest fires to increase

- Therefore: confounder!

<br>

**Does this make sense?**

::: notes
Imagine we are developing a research project whose aim is to estimate the causal effect of 'education' on 'salary.'

- The question becomes, do we believe that 'experience' is a confounder of this mechanism?

- **In other words, do you believe that experience causes education and salary to change or is it something else?**

<br>

Unlike the ice cream example, I suspect that randomly assigning education levels would have BIG effects on salary income!

```

::: notes
Mediators are variables that dilute the effect you are actually interested in.

- This means education has a positive impact on salary AND

- Education increases experience which then increases salary

- In other words, people with more education are more likely to have more significant work experiences and higher pay

<br>

The problem is that our goal is to measure the TOTAL effect of education on salary

- That should include the indirect effect that happens through experience

- In other words, IF we include experience in the identification strategy SOME of the estimated effect will move to the experience variable

- This will give us a too small estimate on education

<br>

If you control for a mediator you will shrink the estimated effect size of interest

- **Does this make sense?**

::: notes
A second note of caution concerns the danger of what are called collider effects or collider bias

- A collider is a variable that is caused by both your predictor and your outcome variable

<br>

If you adjust your analyses to include a collider it will tend to create the illusion of an effect between the predictor and the outcome where none actually exists

- In essence, the fact that each variable causes the same thing will make it appear like they are correlated

<br>

::: notes
In 1979, a researcher named Sackett wanted to examine a hypothesis: 

- Does locomotor disease (a loss of mobility) lead to respiratory disease

- Theory: locomotor disease could lead to inactivity, which could cause respiratory disease.

- Gathers data on 257 hospitalized individuals and finds a strong correlation between the two diseases

<br>

To be thorough he runs a second test 

- This time he gathers data on a sample of 2,783 individuals from the general population

- This test finds no association!

<br>

What happened?

```

::: notes

The first test was spoiled by collider bias

- Both diseases cause hospitalization

- Since Sackett was only studying people ALREADY in the hospital it LOOKED like these two diseases were correlated

- People in the hospital are sicker than people not in the hospital AND sicker people are more likely to have diseases that impact the lungs and their mobility

- By only studying those in the hospital you CHOOSE to control for hospitalization AND THAT creates a correlation where it shouldn't be

<br>

**SLIDE**: The lesson for us since we typically work with observational data

## Colliders as Selection Bias {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/12_2-worldclimateriskmap.avif){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Our work in the social sciences primarily utilizes observational data and in that context collider bias is usually a selection bias problem

<br>

A quick google search gave me a ton of options but here's a Moody's report on the climate change risk to economies around the world.

- Let's say we wanted to analyze the effect of regime type on robustness to climate change

- In other words, we believe that democracies do a better job preparing for future risks than dictatorships

<br>

**What is clearly wrong with using this data to test this hypothesis?**

- (Analyzing this data means pretending most of the poorest countries in the world do not exist)

- That MEANS you are choosing to control for wealth in this analysis

- If wealth is a collider in this relationship then your results will be completely untrustworthy

<br>

The lesson for us is that collider bias is often the result of selection bias!

- Missing data might present as a collider variable!

- Including a collider will make it look like you've found something that isn't actually there.

<br>

**Does this make sense?**

## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(1, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Class\n Size", "Student\n Success")

Ok, let's see what we can take from our brainstormed lists that represent confounders, mediators and colliders.

- Take a minute, talk to the people around you and let's get three lists up on the board

<br>

*REPORT BACK!*

Mediators:

- 

Colliders:

- 

Confounders:

**SLIDE**: Now, keep in mind our goal here is to only keep the confounders!

## Identification and the DGP {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Using theory, paint the most accurate picture possible of what the data generating process looks like

2. **Refine the DGP to only keep variables that confound the key mechanism**

3. Find ways to block out those alternate reasons and so dig out the variation we need

::: notes
Bottom line, our identification strategy SHOULD identify any variable that confounds the relationship we are trying to measure

- Confounding means that the variable, in essence, precedes and causes BOTH the predictor and outcome we are studying

- Pearl's more formal definition asks you to imagine that you could test the relationship with an RCT

- If you believe removing the third variable and randomly assigning the predictor would change the outcome, then the third variable is likely a confounder.

<br>

**Any questions on our work with DAGs and confounders today?**

<br>

Next week we'll learn techniques for doing step 3 here, e.g. adjusting our analysis to "control" for the confounders

- **SLIDE**: But now we go back to our class project!
:::



## For Today {.center background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png"}

<br>

Brainstorm the DGP for our project (e.g. **SUBMIT** three separate lists of reasons why states would vary in):

- Global Press Freedom (Press_Global)

- Environmental Quality (EPI.new)

- Your chosen indicator from the EPI

::: notes
For class today you each submitted to Canvas DGPs for the main variables in our project.

<br>

I'd like you to share your lists with the people around you

- What did you both come up with?

- What did they come up with?

- Don't jump to identifying confounders, colliders or mediators, focus just on whether or not you believe each item on the lists are a credible predictor for our variables

<br>

**IF TIME IS SHORT**: Go to the next slide!
