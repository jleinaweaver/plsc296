### Our **goal** as political scientists is to **generate knowledge** about the social world using the **scientific method**

::: {.incremental}
- Science is the process of testing ideas using empirical data

- Empirical data is generated by measuring the world

- Therefore, our knowledge depends on measurement! 

:::

::: notes

As I've been emphasizing to you all week

- *READ SLIDE*

<br>

**REVEAL**

- Using the scientific method means committing to testing your ideas against the real world

<br>

**REVEAL**

- Converting real world observations into usable data takes measurement

<br>

**REVEAL**

<br>

So, let’s learn to develop useful measurements!

- Chapter 1 from Pollock & Edwards sets us up to do exactly that

::: notes

Before we dig into the material, let's talk about the book

<br>

I reviewed a ton of possible textbooks and this was the best of the bunch in terms of:

- Cost (some were a FORTUNE),

- Specific content covered,

- The order of the content (building logically through research design and stats), and

- Readability

<br>

I'll be very curious to check in with you guys during the semester to see if it is working well for you.

<br>

*Split class into groups of three*

- Sit with your group!

<br>

Let's use the homework for today to highlight some key concepts from the chapter

- We won't always go through the exercises in class in detail but let's make sure we're all getting off on the right foot!

- **SLIDE**: Exercise 1

:::



## Pollock & Edwards (2026) Chapter 1 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

**Exercise 1c: Religiosity in Politics and Society**

- Discuss your conceptual definitions of religiosity

- Make sure each uses the template, focuses on concrete properties of the concept and makes clear the level of analysis

::: notes

Groups, share your answers to Exercise 1c with each other and make sure each of them meets the criteria for a conceptual definition

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

- **Give me an example of a property of religiosity, like in Exercise 1a, that is connected but is probably not enough to be included in our conceptual definitions.**

- **Are all of the proposed definitions done at the individual level of analysis? Give me a conceptual definition at an aggregate level, say the US states.**

<br>

**Any questions on the conceptual definitions material from the chapter?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Exercise 4

:::



## Pollock & Edwards (2026) Chapter 1 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

**Exercise 4: Measuring Political Knowledge**

- Warren: 40, 60, 70, 45

- Xavier: 48, 48, 50, 54

- Yolanda: 49, 50, 51, 50

- Zelda: 45, 44, 44, 46

**Classify: Valid + Reliable, NV + Reliable, Valid + NR, NV + NR**

::: notes

Exercise 4 is designed to make sure you understand validity, reliability, and a little bit, how to calculate the mean.

<br>

Make sure everyone in your group agrees on the answers to 4a - 4d

- Important note: I don't think the textbook does a good job making these distinct enough

- Assign one of the four categories to each person and make them all different categories

<br>

(**SLIDE**: Let's report back)

:::



## Pollock & Edwards (2026) Chapter 1 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

**Exercise 4: Measuring Political Knowledge**

- Warren: 40, 60, 70, 45 (mean: `r mean(c(40, 60, 70, 45))`)

- Xavier: 48, 48, 50, 54 (mean: `r mean(c(48, 48, 50, 54))`)

- Yolanda: 49, 50, 51, 50 (mean: `r mean(c(49, 50, 51, 50))`)

- Zelda: 45, 44, 44, 46 (mean: `r mean(c(45, 44, 44, 46))`)

**Classify: Valid + Reliable, NV + Reliable, Valid + NR, NV + NR**

::: notes

**Report back**

- (Yolanda is high validity and reliability)
    
- (Xavier is valid but less reliable than Yolanda)

- (Zelda is low validity (avg 44.75) but high reliability (measurements are very consistent).)
    
- (Warren is lower validity (average 53.75) AND low reliability.)

<br>

Let's say you were designing a survey question to measure political knowledge.

- Obviously you would want a question that is valid and reliable, but nailing both of those things is HARD

- **For the purposes of generating new knowledge about the world would you rather have a survey instrument that was not valid, but reliable OR valid, but not reliable? Why?**

<br>

I like this set of fake data because it helps us answer this question.

- It's pretty clear to me that I would MUCH rather use Xavier's tool rather than Zelda's!

<br>

**Any questions on these VERY important concepts of validity and reliability?**

<br>

<br>

**SLIDE**: Finally we focus on types of validity

:::



## Pollock & Edwards (2026) Chapter 1 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

**Exercise 7: The Environment vs the Economy**

```{r, fig.asp=.1}
tibble(
  x = 1:7,
  y = 0
) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(color = "white") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:7, labels = c("Environment", 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, "Jobs"), minor_breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  labs(x = "", y = "")
```

- **Face validity?**

- **Best construct validity with abortion, climate change, or business regulation?**

::: notes

Last one groups, get on the same page with your answers to Exercise 7 and get ready to report back.

- Go!

<br>

**Do we accept this scale has face validity? Why or why not?**

- (The scale has low face validity.)

- While the scale attempts to measure the trade-off between protecting the environment and prioritizing jobs, its binary framing oversimplifies a complex issue. 

- Many individuals may hold nuanced opinions that do not align with a single point on the scale. 

    - For example, someone might support environmental protection in some cases but prioritize job creation in others, depending on the context. 
    - This measure fails to capture such subtleties, making it less likely to accurately gauge the intended characteristic.)

<br>

Let's say we could add other questions to the survey to allow us to check for the construct validity of this instrument

- **Which of the three options give us the best shot at demonstrating construct validity?**

- (Climate change provides the best test of construct validity)

- Climate change is a central issue within environmental policy and is highly likely to correlate with opinions on the environment-versus-jobs trade-off. 

- We expect a negative correlation between respondents’ placement on the scale and their level of concern about climate change. Individuals closer to “protect environment” (point 1) would express higher concern about climate change, while those closer to “jobs more important” (point 7) would express lower concern.

<br>

**Any questions about demonstrating either face validity or construct validity?**

<br>

::: notes

With those discussions under our belt, I'd like your first impressions of the book.

- **What did you think of Chapter 1? Was it an easy enough read?**

- **Did the exercise questions make sense?**

- **Did the exercises help you better understand the concepts in the chapter?**

<br>

With the rest of our time today I'd like us to keep exploring the importance and difficulty of measuring concepts

- So, what I'm going to do is throw out some questions and in your groups you will get ready to report back your answers

- The goal is for you to find answers on the web that we can evaluate using our concepts from today

<br>

**SLIDE**: Question 1

:::

### What was the population of the USA in 2025?

::: notes

Groups go find us an answer BUT only if you can also find information on HOW that answer was constructed

- e.g. How was population measured?

- Track it down the rabbit hole! Go!

<br>

*Have people keep us in the loop on what they are finding as they work*

- *Encourage open collaboration and direction to good sources!*

- *Odds are this all ends up on some pages of the Census Bureau*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk about population as a measurement challenge 

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Measuring the population of the USA in 2025 requires:**

1. Defining the Concept

2. Specifying the Tool

3. Specifying the Process

4. Testing for Robustness

:::

::: notes

On Monday we played with rulers and class heights in order to identify the four broad tasks necessary to create a useful measurement.

- Let's apply these to the population measurement challenge

<br>

**In terms of a conceptual definition of population, what would we need to consider?**

- WHO should be counted? Citizens vs residents vs people

- WHAT should be counted? 

    - An average after all births, deaths, immigrations, etc? 
    - Or a snapshot on Jan 1st? Or July 1st? or Dec 31st?

<br>

Everybody grab a copy of the 2020 Census form so we can evaluate the tool [LINK](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/technical-documentation/questionnaires-and-instructions/questionnaires/2020-informational-questionnaire-english_DI-Q1.pdf).

- **Scroll through it and report back to me, is this likely to be a valid tool for counting the population? Why or why not?**

- The census form itself is both simple and complicated!

- Trump admin tried hard to add a citizenship question to the form wither to develop a better count of the undocumented OR to lay the groundwork for excluding those populations from congressional representation.

<br>

**In terms of the process of distributing and collecting this survey, what would we need to consider?**

- Large homeless population very hard to count with mailers!

- Many undocumented afraid to answer the door when census takers knock

- Minority groups frequently undercounted because of how hard it is to locate individuals in an urban setting

<br>

**In terms of validating the results, what would we need to consider?**

- NO single list of people held by the government, not even a list of just citizens

- Congress has put in place roadblocks to using statistical sampling procedures to verify these wildly innaccurate headcounts.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, so where does that leave us?

:::



## {background-image="Images/01_2-census_mailer.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Clearly counting the population of any large country is INCREDIBLY hard.

<br>

Based on your work for today, talk to me about how we should and should not use our population counts.

**In other words, what is a question we can answer using the population data produced by the Census Bureau?**

<br>

**And what is a question we cannot usefully answer with this data?**

<br>

Am I just being weirdly pedantic here?

- **SLIDE**: NOPE!
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_2-census_apportionment-2020-map01.png" .center background-size='90%'}

::: notes

Probably the most important thing the census population count is used for is changing the apportionment of seats in Congress

- e.g. growing areas get more house members, shrinking ones lose representation

<br>

**Is our census count likely to have been precise enough for this VERY important task (reapportioning reps in Congress)? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Can you see here how urban areas appear to be losing out in the current process?**

<br>

As ever, there is politics in everything!

<br>

Let's try this one more time with something easier

- **SLIDE**

### How many countries are there in the world?

::: notes

Groups go find us an answer BUT only if you can also find information on HOW that answer was constructed

- Track it down the rabbit hole! Go!

<br>

*Have people keep us in the loop on what they are finding as they work*

- *Encourage open collaboration and direction to good sources!*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk about this measurement challenge 

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Counting the countries in the world in 2025 requires:**

1. Defining the Concept

2. Specifying the Tool

3. Specifying the Process

4. Testing for Robustness

:::

::: notes

The key challenge to this exercise will focus on the conceptual and operational definitions of a country.

<br>

**What are the big measurement challenges to defining a country?**

- What is a state? How much sovereign control is necessary?

- What about places of ongoing civil conflict (Libya, Ethiopia, South Sudan)?

- What about territories like Puerto Rico with many obligations to the US (pay taxes, serve in war) but not all the benefits (no social security)?

- If your tool focuses on wide recognition: What do we do about China's pressure campaign against Taiwan including both threats and bribery?

- If your tool focuses on recognition by IOs: Israel's threats against the UN and smaller countries for allowing Palestine observer status at the UN 

- If your tool focuses on economic or military strength: What about Russian support for breakaway "republics" across the old USSR (Transnistria, Abkhazia, Crimea, Donetsk, etc.)?

- UN membership is a political exercise not a rigorous definition per international law but carries great weight in many aspects of the world.
    - See the struggles of the Taliban to claim Afghanistan's seat in the UN

## Number of countries in the world? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-UN_Map_Wikipedia.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

**Ok, so, how many countries are there in the world?**

<br>

I really like this exercise as a way to both think about the importance of measurement AND to understand how context matters for using data

- Arguably there is NO single definition of a country and, even if there was, you probably wouldn't want to use it

- Your job as a social scientist is to construct the definition you need to answer the question you have

<br>

Are you analyzing state dynamics in international organizations and negotiations?

- Then the UN definition is probably the right approach because the price of getting to attend the negotiation is recognition!

<br>

Are you analyzing international conflicts like war or the spread of disease?

- Then you might prefer a definition that focuses on local sovereign control of a territory REGARDLESS of international recognition!

<br>

**Does all of this make sense?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: The takeaway

## Science as Measurement {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

:::: {.r-fit-text}
::: {.incremental}
1. Science means answering questions with data

2. Data is generated by measuring the empirical world

3. All measurements include uncertainty

4. So, all answers include uncertainty
:::
::::

::: notes

**REVEAL**: THIS is what it means to do science

- Anyone trying to answer research questions with data in transparent, replicatable ways is doing science

- Regardless of the subject of study.

<br>

**REVEAL**: Unlike other disciplines, science roots its knowledge in what we can observe

- Not just what we can deduce, or what we believe

- *Define empirical: "based on, concerned with, or verifiable by observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic" (OED).*

<br>

**REVEAL x 2**: And here's the kicker.

- Since all measures are uncertain that means **ALL SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IS UNCERTAIN**

<br>

HOWEVER, that doesn't mean we don't know anything

- Scientific knowledge is valuable because it acknowledges its limitations right up front.

- No hiding what we don't know!

<br>

Science is not about revealing truth, it's about describing the world.

- We prefer descriptions based on how clear they are and how well they can describe their uncertainty

- Scientific progress often comes from us finding better ways to shrink or address the uncertainty

<br>

Fundamentally, that's our job this semester

- My hope is that our work this week has helped you think a bit more deeply about population and the international state system

- We don't have great answers for those two questions yet, but you should now have a MUCH better sense of what we don't know about each of them and what it would take to build us a better measure of each!

<br>

**Any questions on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: With that in mind...
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-quote-von-neumann.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

I have never come across a quote that spoke more to my experience of being a social scientist.

- This isn't just an excellent quote about math, but an excellent quote about the scientific process and the challenges of causal inference.

- Using data to answer questions is hard, but it just sort of gets easier with time and practice.

<br>

So, hang in there this semester and embrace the journey.

- By the end of the semester you too will have learned enough research design, math and programming skills to make some cool things and answer some challenging questions.

- My promise is that you'll even understand enough of what you're doing to be dangerous!
:::



## This semester you will develop skills: {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

- **Evaluating** data for uncertainty,

- **Cleaning** the data for analysis,

- **Describing** the variation in the data,

- **Analyzing** the variation in the data, and

- **Reporting** your findings in clear and compelling ways.

::: notes

We have three learning outcomes for this class and they are listed on the syllabus.

- You should definitely read them.

- HOWEVER, I think this summarizes the hands-on goals for our semester nicely.

<br>

Next week we continue our practice of evaluating and analyzing measurements

Next class we will dig into the work of Freedom House both at a conceptual level AND we'll start to dig into the data as well

- This means everybody needs to bring a laptop to class starting next week

- If you do not have one please let me know ASAP so we can arrange access to a laptop for you during class from the Computer Science department

<br>

**Any questions on our work from today or the assignment for next class?**

1. What are TWO reasons the measure of political rights produced by Freedom House is valid and/or reliable?
2. What are TWO reasons the measure of political rights produced by Freedom House is NOT valid and/or reliable?
3. What are TWO reasons the measure of civil liberties produced by Freedom House is valid and/or reliable?
4. What are TWO reasons the measure of civil liberties produced by Freedom House is NOT valid and/or reliable?

## Old slides to save

## Number of current wars? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-ukraine_fighting.webp){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Ok groups, next question!
- Still looking for two things

- 5 mins, get to it!

<br>

*ON BOARD*

1. "Best" answer ranges
    - Present and discuss each
    
2. Sources of uncertainty (4 columns)
    - Subject, Tool, Process, Validation

<br>

**SLIDE**: Wikipedia entry

<br>

### OLD NOTES

**Definitions Matter**

- What is "war" in 2023?
- All of the following can be tied to increased costs in terms of blood and treasure for Russia: Economic sanctions, direct monetary support to Ukraine, direct provision of arms to Ukraine, training of Ukrainian soldiers BUT DO THEY ADD UP TO WAR?
- Correlates of War project: "sustained combat, involving organized armed forces, resulting in a minimum of 1,000 battle-related fatalities within a twelve month period"
    - MIDs: Militarized interstate disputes

**Tools Matter**

- How do you translate complex conceptual definitions of "war" into clear and measurable criteria?

**Process Matters**

- How do you get reliable information on what is happening on the ground in Russia (no free press) or Ukraine (active war ongoing)?

**Validation Matters**

- Lots of groups offering "reports" on destruction, alleged war crimes, fatalities, but almost all VERY conflicting.
:::



## Number of current wars? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-2023_Ongoing_conflicts_around_the_world.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

The [wikipedia entry of "ongoing armed conflicts"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts) is now one of the first things to pop up on a Google search of this question.

- Draws on a number of good quality sources but mixes them together in some ways the designers of those measures would probably be concerned by.

<br>

Measuring war is REALLY, REALLY hard

- Should we include ongoing non-lethal violence such as the Chinese navy assaulting Philippines ships in the SCS
    
    - Water canons, blinding lasers, close quarters maneuvers but no killing

- Should we include serious acts of economic violence like the US sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine?
    
    - What about NATO providing arms to Ukraine?

- Should we include serious acts of violence happening within a single state's borders such as:
    
    - China targeting Uighyur muslims (genocide?)
    
    - Myanmar military targeting Rohingya (also genocide?)
    
    - And many, many, many more
    
- Should we include violence by non-state actors (e.g. terrorism or rebellion) such as that done by ISIS in Iran and Syria or the Pakistani Taliban's attack on the Pakistani government?

<br>

Measuring "war" requires extreme care in defining the subject, tool, process and validation procedures you plan on using.

<br>

Given all this, report back on this final question

### What is a question we can answer using this data?

<br>

### And what is a question we cannot or should not answer with this data?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, let's reinforce what we've discussed about measurement this week
