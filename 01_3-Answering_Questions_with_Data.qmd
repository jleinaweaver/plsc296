::: notes

**Any questions about the class from your review of the syllabus?**

<br>

Our job this semester is to design and execute a research project
- Your grade is heavy on being in class and collaborating to get this done

<br>

### Is the attendance policy clear?
1. Attendance cliff: > 4 unexcused absences = 'C'
2. YOUR JOB to request make-up assignments from excused absences

<br>

### Does everybody understand how to earn the participation points?
- Come to class on-time,
- Be engaged while in class (e.g., bring all needed materials, don’t distract others, etc.), and
- Submit all required daily assignments BEFORE class begins.

<br>

### Does everybody see where the readings for each class are assigned and know how to access them?

<br>

### Any questions on using Canvas?

::: notes

Important Note: I expect each of you to save and backup your work in this class to the cloud on a daily basis. 

- I will not accept lost or broken computers as excuses for incomplete assignments and missed deadlines.

<br>

### Is everybody already backing up to the cloud (e.g. iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.)?

OneDrive backup is FREE for Drury students!

- Let me know if you need help with this.

## Assignment for Today {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

1. Population of the USA in 2024?

2. Number of countries in the world today?

3. Number of wars in the world today?

<br>

**Complete answers include specificity, sourcing and an argument that this measurement is useful.**

::: notes

Our first participation assignment was due today.

<br>

Before we get to the answers, let's talk in broad strokes about the assignment.

### How did it go? How did you attack this?

<br>

*Split class into small groups (3)*

- You must form a group with NEW people (not the group you worked with on the assignment)

- I want each group to draw on different approaches and have different answers

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's dig in!
:::


## Population of the USA in 2024 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_2-Satellite-Map-USA.jpg")
```

<br>

1. "Best" answer (with confidence interval)?

2. Key sources of uncertainty? Subject, Tool, Process, Validation

::: notes

Groups, discuss all the submitted answers to our first question and get ready to report back two things

1. What is our "best" answer to the question (e.g. with confidence interval)?
    - You are NOT picking a single submission, but identifying a useful range that you are confident includes the "real" answer.
    
2. What are the primary sources of uncertainty in our answer?
    - Identify AT LEAST ONE source of uncertainty for each of the four aspects of measurement we discussed last class
    
<br>

### Everybody understand what I want?

- 5 mins, get to it!

<br>

*ON BOARD*

1. "Best" answer ranges
    - Present and discuss each
    
2. Sources of uncertainty (4 columns)
    - Subject, Tool, Process, Validation

<br>

NOTES

**Subject Definitions Matter**

- WHO should be counted? Citizens vs residents vs people
- WHAT should be counted? An average after all births, deaths, immigrations, etc? Or a snapshot on Jan 1st? Or July 1st? or Dec 31st?

**Tools Matter**

- The census form itself is both simple and complicated!
- Trump admin tried hard to add a citizenship question to the form wither to develop a better count of the undocumented OR to lay the groundwork for excluding those populations from congressional representation.

**Process Matters**

- NO single list of people held by the government, not even a list of just citizens
- Large homeless population very hard to count with mailers!
- Many undocumented afraid to answer the door when census takers knock
- Minority groups frequently undercounted because of how hard it is to locate individuals in an urban setting

**Validation Matters**

- Congress has put in place roadblocks to using statistical sampling procedures to verify these wildly innaccurate headcounts.

:::



## {background-image="Images/01_2-census_mailer.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Clearly counting the population of any large country is INCREDIBLY hard.

<br>

Based on your work for today, talk to me about how we should and should not use our population counts.

### In other words, what is a question we can answer using this data?

<br>

### And what is a question we cannot usefully answer with this data?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Is it accurate enough for reapportionment?
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_2-census_apportionment-2020-map01.png" .center background-size='90%'}

::: notes

Probably the most important thing the census population count is used for is changing the apportionment of seats in Congress

- e.g. growing areas get more house members, shrinking ones lose representation

<br>

### Is our census count likely to have been precise enough for this VERY important task (reapportioning reps in Congress)? Why or why not?

<br>

### Can you see here how urban areas appear to be losing out in the current process?

Politics in everything!

1. "Best" answer (with confidence interval)?

2. Key sources of uncertainty? Subject, Tool, Process, Validation

::: notes

Ok groups, next question!

- Still looking for two things

- 5 mins, get to it!

<br>

*ON BOARD*

1. "Best" answer ranges
    - Present and discuss each
    
2. Sources of uncertainty (4 columns)
    - Subject, Tool, Process, Validation

<br>

#### NOTES

**Subject Definitions Matter**

- What is a state? How much sovereign control is necessary?
- What about places of ongoing civil conflict (Libya, Ethiopia, South Sudan)?
- What about territories like Puerto Rico with many obligations to the US (pay taxes, serve in war) but not all the benefits (no social security)?

**Tools Matter**

- How do you translate complex conceptual definitions of statehood into clear and measurable criteria?

**Process Matters**

- If your tool focuses on wide recognition: What do we do about China's pressure campaign against Taiwan including both threats and bribery?

- If your tool focuses on recognition by IOs: Israel's threats against the UN and smaller countries for allowing Palestine observer status at the UN 

- If your tool focuses on economic or military strength: What about Russian support for breakaway "republics" across the old USSR (Transnistria, Abkhazia, Crimea, Donetsk, etc.)?


**Validation Matters**

- UN membership is a political exercise not a rigorous definition per international law but carries great weight in many aspects of the world.
    - See the struggles of the Taliban to claim Afghanistan's seat in the UN

Given all this, report back on Q2

### What is a question we can answer using this data?

<br>

### And what is a question we cannot or should not answer with this data?
:::




## Number of current wars? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: notes

Ok groups, next question!
- Still looking for two things

- 5 mins, get to it!

<br>

*ON BOARD*

1. "Best" answer ranges
    - Present and discuss each
    
2. Sources of uncertainty (4 columns)
    - Subject, Tool, Process, Validation

<br>

**SLIDE**: Wikipedia entry

<br>

### OLD NOTES

**Definitions Matter**

- What is "war" in 2023?
- All of the following can be tied to increased costs in terms of blood and treasure for Russia: Economic sanctions, direct monetary support to Ukraine, direct provision of arms to Ukraine, training of Ukrainian soldiers BUT DO THEY ADD UP TO WAR?
- Correlates of War project: "sustained combat, involving organized armed forces, resulting in a minimum of 1,000 battle-related fatalities within a twelve month period"
    - MIDs: Militarized interstate disputes

**Tools Matter**

- How do you translate complex conceptual definitions of "war" into clear and measurable criteria?

**Process Matters**

- How do you get reliable information on what is happening on the ground in Russia (no free press) or Ukraine (active war ongoing)?

**Validation Matters**

- Lots of groups offering "reports" on destruction, alleged war crimes, fatalities, but almost all VERY conflicting.
:::



## Number of current wars? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-2023_Ongoing_conflicts_around_the_world.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

The [wikipedia entry of "ongoing armed conflicts"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts) is now one of the first things to pop up on a Google search of this question.

- Draws on a number of good quality sources but mixes them together in some ways the designers of those measures would probably be concerned by.

<br>

Measuring war is REALLY, REALLY hard

- Should we include ongoing non-lethal violence such as the Chinese navy assaulting Philippines ships in the SCS
    
    - Water canons, blinding lasers, close quarters maneuvers but no killing

- Should we include serious acts of economic violence like the US sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine?
    
    - What about NATO providing arms to Ukraine?

- Should we include serious acts of violence happening within a single state's borders such as:
    
    - China targeting Uighyur muslims (genocide?)
    
    - Myanmar military targeting Rohingya (also genocide?)
    
    - And many, many, many more
    
- Should we include violence by non-state actors (e.g. terrorism or rebellion) such as that done by ISIS in Iran and Syria or the Pakistani Taliban's attack on the Pakistani government?

<br>

Measuring "war" requires extreme care in defining the subject, tool, process and validation procedures you plan on using.

<br>

Given all this, report back on this final question

### What is a question we can answer using this data?

<br>

### And what is a question we cannot or should not answer with this data?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, let's reinforce what we've discussed about measurement this week
:::



## Science as Measurement {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

:::: {.r-fit-text}
::: {.incremental}
1. Science means answering questions with data

2. Data is generated by measuring the empirical world

3. All measurements include uncertainty

4. So, all answers include uncertainty
:::
::::

::: notes

**REVEAL**: THIS is what it means to do science

- Anyone trying to answer research questions with data in transparent, replicatable ways is doing science

- Regardless of the subject of study.

<br>

**REVEAL**: Unlike other disciplines, science roots its knowledge in what we can observe

- Not just what we can deduce, or what we believe

- *Define empirical: "based on, concerned with, or verifiable by observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic" (OED).*

<br>

**REVEAL x 2**: And here's the kicker.

- Since all measures are uncertain that means **ALL SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IS UNCERTAIN**

<br>

HOWEVER, that doesn't mean we don't know anything

- Scientific knowledge is valuable because it acknowledges its limitations right up front.

- No hiding what we don't know!

<br>

Science is not about revealing truth, it's about describing the world.

- We prefer descriptions based on how clear they are and how well they can describe their uncertainty

- Scientific progress often comes from us finding better ways to shrink or address the uncertainty

<br>

Fundamentally, that's our job this semester

- My hope is that our work this week has helped you think a bit more deeply about population, the international state system and the nature of war.

- We don't have great answers for those three questions yet, but you should now have a MUCH better sense of what we don't know about each of them and what it would take to build us a better measure of each!

<br>

### Any questions on this?

<br>

**SLIDE**: With that in mind...
:::

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/01_2-quote-von-neumann.jpg')
```

::: notes

I have never come across a quote that spoke more to my experience of being a social scientist.

- This isn't just an excellent quote about math, but an excellent quote about the scientific process and the challenges of causal inference.

- Using data to answer questions is hard, but it just sort of gets easier with time and practice.

<br>

So, hang in there this semester and embrace the journey.

- By the end of the semester you too will have learned enough research design, math and programming skills to make some cool things and answer some challenging questions.

- My promise is that you'll even understand enough of what you're doing to be dangerous!
:::



## This semester you will develop skills: {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

- **Evaluating** data for uncertainty,

- **Cleaning** the data for analysis,

- **Describing** the variation in the data,

- **Analyzing** the variation in the data, and

- **Reporting** your findings in clear and compelling ways.

::: notes

We have three learning outcomes for this class and they are listed on the syllabus.

- You should definitely read them.

<br>

HOWEVER, I think this summarizes the hands-on goals for our semester nicely.
