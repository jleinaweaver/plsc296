PLSC 296: IDEA Course Evaluation Link

Morning All,

Here is the link to our course evaluation survey: https://drury.campuslabs.com/eval-home/

Thanks,

JL

## Report 4 {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Multivariate test of the mechanism**
:::

<br>

**Are powerful states more likely to respect the human rights of their citizens?**

::: {.fragment}

- Use all of the data

- Focus on CINC (not the indicators)

:::

::: notes

Same over-arching aim as Report 3 but with our new tools:

- The goal: Answer our research question using multivariate analyses

<br>

**REVEAL**: For this final report I would like you to:

1. Use all of the data (not just 2016)

2. Focus on the primary mechanism: cinc -> human rights

<br>

We won't include the tests of the indicators in this report.

## Report 4 {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The body of the paper must...**
:::

::: {.incremental}
1. Explain your theoretical argument

2. Explain your identification strategy

3. Evaluate the quality of the data

4. Analyze the outcome variable

5. Analyze the mechanism using multivariate regressions AND visualizations
:::

::: notes

First and foremost your report must be written with a clear macro structure

- e.g. a clear and compelling introduction, a thorough and distinct body and a conclusion that wraps everything up for the reader

<br>

The body of your paper must cover the following five elements (**REVEAL x 5**):

1. e.g. why you believe the predictor causes the outcome
    
2. e.g. why you selected these confounders

3. e.g. the sources of the data and the strengths and weaknesses of each variable you have chosen

4. e.g. univariate analysis: What is it you are trying to explain and how much variation is there in the world according to this variable?

5. Analyze the theoretical mechanism using multivariate regressions AND visualizations

<br>

**Questions on any of these elements?**

## Report 4: Notes {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}

- Submit a **pdf** to **Canvas** (due **May 8th, 12:20p**)

- All figures and tables in the paper must be **polished** (e.g. presentation ready)

- All regressions must be evaluated using **all of the steps** reviewed in class

- Lead all paragraphs with **ideas**, NOT with evidence

- You must support **all assertions of fact** in the paper with cited evidence or data analysis (including an APA bibliography)
