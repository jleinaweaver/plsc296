**Your argument must:**

- Explain your theoretical argument (e.g. the mechanism by which changes in the predictor CAUSE changes in the outcome),

- Explain your identification strategy (e.g. why include these confounders),

- Acknowledge the uncertainty (e.g. how do we use this data despite the problems in the measures?), and

- Test the theory using multivariate regressions AND visualizations

::: notes

**Questions on the assignment?**

- All details are on Canvas

<br>

Plan for today: I would like everyone to create all the regressions and visualizations

- Don't stress polishing anything eyt, let's just get lots of stuff made!

- Go!

<br>

For Wednesday I want you to polish everything and be ready to share in class.
