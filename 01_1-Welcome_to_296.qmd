**For those who have taken 101, what kinds of data did you examine in that class?**

- **In other words, what kinds of evidence did you consider when making arguments?**

<br>

**What kinds of data or datasets did you explore in Comparative?**

<br>

**And in IR, what kinds of data or datasets did you explore?**

::: notes

The second three courses, inquiry, data analysis and research design, are designed to teach you how to do your own research

- Not just to read and consider how others have asked and answered big questions, but how YOU can ask and answer them too

- And that's exactly what you'll have to do in Senior Seminar!

<br>

**What was the aim of the Inquiry class?**

- **What did we ask you to do in that class?**

<br>

The Inquiry class is meant to teach you to set up a high quality research project.

- This means you each designed a compelling research question, 

- You explored the academic literature to find the best current answers to that question, and then 

- Proposed new answers to that question using theory

<br>

In this class, I will introduce you to the concepts and skills you will need to test your theories with empirical evidence

- In other words, you have a question about the world and you've identified the extent of our knowledge so now it's time to push forward and help us create NEW knowledge!

- THAT's what data analysis is about.

Welcome to Data Analysis in Political Science!

<br>

Over the last year (or more) you've taken some political science classes.

- **What I'd like to know is, based on those experiences, what are the kinds of questions political scientists ask about the world?**

- **Feel free to give us the question you developed in 160!**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Big picture goal of the discipline

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

Our **goal** as political scientists:

:::: {.incremental}

- To **generate knowledge** about the social world

- The method is **"science"**

- The key is **"measurement"**
:::
::::

::: notes

**REVEAL**: The big goal of political science is to understand how the social world works,

- How do societies make rules?

- How do we enforce the rules? And which rules get enforced?

- Who gets to belong to a given community? Who do we welcome and who do we shun?

- What happens when our obligations to different institutions conflict?

<br>

**REVEAL**: We work to generate knowledge using SCIENCE

- Science is empirical, verifiable, and replicatable

<br>

**REVEAL**: Empirical means rooted in real-world observation

- Using real world observations means ALL QUESTIONS are a measurement problem

<br>

And let me be super clear, measurement doesn't require numbers!

- The moment when you see a friend frown at what you said and you interpret what that means YOU are gathering data and analyzing it in the moment

- This means that getting better at measuring the world will benefit you in EVERY aspect of your life.

<br>

Given this focus, let's kick off our first class today with a simple measurement warm-up!

- **SLIDE**: I would like you to describe the heights of the class
:::



## Warm-up Exercise {background-image="Images/background-teal4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**The Big Aim**

- Describe the distribution of student heights in our class

:::

::: notes

What I would like you to do is describe for me the distribution of heights in this class.

<br>

Ideally, you will be able to provide me with descriptive summaries of our class more useful than an answer of trying to just eyeball the group of you.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's begin with a fairly simple method...
:::



## Warm-up Exercise {background-image="Images/background-teal4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Describe the distribution of student heights in our class**

<br>

Order the students in our class by height (shortest to tallest)

:::

::: notes

To answer this question I will ask you to stand up and organize yourselves into a line by height (from the shortest to the tallest)

- *Let them work on this on their own*

<br>

Ok, let me see your answer:

**FIRST, please describe for me how you completed this task. Be specific.**

<br>

**SECOND, describe for me the sources of uncertainty in this answer?**
    
- **In other words, what parts of your answer are you most confident in?**

- **And what parts the least?**

<br>
    
**FINALLY, and thanks to your work, what do I know about the distribution of heights in the class that I didn't before?**

<br>

Thanks to this measurement exercise I now know:

- What the middle of our distribution looks like

- How spread around the middle the class is

- The extreme values in the class

- etc.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's tweak our exercise and try it again...
:::


## Warm-up Exercise {background-image="Images/background-teal4.png" .center}

**Describe the distribution of student heights in our class**

<br>

What is the specific range of heights of the students in our class (minimum to maximum in inches)?

::: notes

Work together and get ready to report back to me!

- I brought rulers if you need them!

- *Let them work on this on their own*

<br>

Ok, let me see your answer

**FIRST, please describe for me how you completed this task. Be specific.**

<br>

**SECOND, describe for me the sources of uncertainty in this answer?**
    
- **In other words, what parts of your answer are you most confident in?**

- **And what parts the least?**

<br>
    
**FINALLY, and thanks to your work, what do I know about the distribution of heights in the class that I didn't before?**

- Usefully quantifies the maximum difference in the class (e.g. the range)

    - Important if designing a space shuttle and need to make sure we all fit!

- BUT doesn't tell us anything about the distribution within the range

    - So, a bad description if the question is to get a sense of heights within the range
    
<br>

**Make sense?**

- The line-up method gave me useful information about the similarities and differences within the class

- The max range exercise gave me precise descriptions of the limits of the range

<br>

**SLIDE**: One more time!
:::


## Warm-up Exercise {background-image="Images/background-teal4.png" .center}

**Describe the distribution of student heights in our class**

<br>

What is the average height of the students in our class (to the nearest millimeter)?

::: notes

*Let them work on this on their own*

<br>

Ok, let me see your answer

**FIRST, please describe for me how you completed this task. Be specific.**

<br>

**SECOND, describe for me the sources of uncertainty in this answer?**
    
- **In other words, what parts of your answer are you most confident in?**

- **And what parts the least?**

<br>
    
**Thanks to your work, what do I know about the distribution of heights in the class that I didn't before?**

<br>

**When would this precise measure of average be more useful than the range or the line-up?**

<br>

Again, depends entirely on the question being asked!

- Although in this case, beware false precision!

## What do we learn about "height" from our warm-up exercises? {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

- Order by height

- Range in inches

- Average in millimeter

::: notes
**Ok, what do we learn about "height" from our warm-up measurement exercises?**

<br>

Describing the "height" of the class can be done in a BUNCH of different ways and not all of them required a ruler!

<br>

We first used rank ordering to describe the class which gave us a sense of the distribution of heights

- Are we a tall or short group collectively?

- Would we make a good basketball team?

<br>

We then shifted to summarizing the heights of the class

- In other words, maybe we don't need to know everyone's height!

<br>

The range is a number that tells us how spread out we are as a group

- Want to sell class t-shirts? The range (min and max) tells you how many sizes to offer

<br>

The average tells us something about the middle of the class

- What is a single number that represents the bulk of the class?

<br>

All three of these measurement approaches gave us useful data

- A big part of being a social scientist is figuring out which method is the "right" one to answer a given question, and

- Scientists spend A LOT of their time working to improve their measurements of the world

::: notes

So, how do work to improve the usefulness of our measurements?

- We do it by considering these four things

<br>

I) Useful measurements require clear definitions of the subject you are studying

- I don't care how fancy your statistics are, you can't measure something until you define it

- AND if the definition is poorly specified or illogical than the measurements are useless!

<br>

For our warm-up exercise I asked you to describe the distribution of heights in our "class."

- **Before getting to work, how did you agree a definition of the "class"?**

<br>

"Subject" questions often focus on "who" is in the group:

- Who is in the "class"?

- Is the teacher or TA? We are both learning right alongside you, don't we count?

- Is it anyone enrolled as a student regardless of year in school or major?

<br>

Bottom line, you cannot measure something until you carefully define the subject of your study.

- There's a lot of data out there and people make the mistake of interpreting it without first understanding WHAT it actually focuses on

:::: {.column width="65%"}

![](Images/01_1-Height_rulers.jpg){.absolute width="55%" right=0}

::::
:::::

::: notes

II) Useful measurements require the use of valid tools

- A "valid" tool is one that generates measures that accurately represent the key elements of your definition.

<br>

In our height example:

- Do the rulers focus on measuring length?

- Are the markings clear?

- Do the markings line up with the ends of the ruler well?

- Are the rulers long enough for the job at hand?
:::

:::: {.column width="65%"}

![](Images/01_1-Height_technique_v1.png){.absolute width="40%" right=0}

::::
:::::

::: notes

III) Useful measurements require reliable processes

- A "reliable" process is clearly explained and generates the same results each time it is used.

<br>

In terms of our height measurements:

- Did everyone agree on a specific height measuring process?

    - Does hair count towards height? 
    
    - Do shoes?
    
    - What about cultural or religious dress that adds height but that you'd never leave the house without?

- Did everyone follow the process perfectly?

- Are the rulers sufficiently well made that they will not warp through use?

:::

+ **Validation**
:::
:::
::: {.column width="65%"}

![](Images/01_1-Height_calibration.jpg){.absolute width="55%" right=0}

:::
::::

::: notes

IV) Useful measurements require external validation

- As a bonus, measurements are most certain when they are consistent with other attempts to measure the same concept.

<br>

Again, for the height exercise:

- Did the manufacturer of the ruler tie their work to an official or external authoritative source? Have the ruler length's been checked?

- Did you check each others' work when measuring?

<br>

**Do all four of these make "big picture" sense?**

- We'll get into the details of these all semester long
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Science answers questions with measurements**

<br>

**Every measurement is uncertain**

<br>

**So, every answer includes uncertainty**
:::

::: notes

Bottom line time!

- Science is not about revealing "truth", it is about answering questions with data

<br>

Key lesson for all researchers: Every measure is uncertain and that means every answer is also uncertain

<br>

Our job is to create measures that are precise enough to answer the questions we are asking.

<br>



You clearly have a good enough sense of your height to navigate most parts of your life (e.g. can I fit in this room? Do I need bigger pants?)

- Even a cheap wooden 12" ruler will let us order the class by height! That's the point.

<br>

HOWEVER, a precise class average to a small degree of error will require WAY more effort to produce.

- Key if you're trying to launch a space ship, create fusion or argue that raising the minimum wage will raise or lower unemployment!
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**To create useful measurements you must:**

1. Define the Concept

2. Specify the Tool

3. Specify the Process

4. Test for Robustness

:::

::: notes

Let's write down some guidelines!

<br>

Useful measurements must always:

- Define the key concept (e.g. what is human height?)

- Specify the tool used (e.g. ruler type, size, material),

- Specify the process employed (e.g. how to stand, where, ruler held, etc.), and

- Consider how it can be validated.

<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

Good, let's try to measure something harder!
:::



## Assignment for Next Class {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

1. What was the population of the United States of America in 2024?

2. How many countries are there in the world today?

3. How many wars are currently ongoing in the world?

::: notes

Here's your first assignment for the class.

#### To earn your first participation point:

- Due **BEFORE CLASS** on Friday

- Submit to our discussion board on **Canvas**.

- I will give you the rest of class today to work on this.

<br>

### Are the questions clear? Do you understand what I'm asking?

:::




## Assignment for Next Class {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Population of the USA in 2024?

2. Number of countries in the world today?

3. Number of wars in the world today?

<br>

**Measurement Elements:**

- Definitions, Tools, Process and Validation

::: notes

To clarify: I'm not asking you to find and adopt someone else's answer.

- This isn't a simple "let me Google that for you" exercise.

<br>

Your job is to think critically about how each of these questions is a significant measurement challenge.

- Think carefully about how an answer to each question depends on the elements we've discussed today: **definitions, tools, process and validation.**

## Assignment for Next Class {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

1. Population of the USA in 2024?
2. Number of countries in the world today?
3. Number of wars in the world today?

**The Assignment Requires:**

- A specific answer, 
- the source(s) used (APA), and 
- an argument, focused on measurement, that your answer is useful (3+ sentences).

::: notes

For each question you must provide:

1. A specific answer in a complete sentence, 

2. The source in APA format (see the Purdue OWL for guidance), and

3. An argument that this is a useful answer **focused on the measurement and the data**
    - **e.g. explain how you used the source(s) to define the concept, select a tool or accept the process they followed and why you are confident in it**
    - Do not rely on claims of authority (e.g. they are experts), our job is to evaluate the actual measures
    - 3-5 sentences

<br>

### Questions?

The discussion board on canvas will stop accepting entries when class starts on Friday.

This means the point depends on submitting in time!

Let's get to it!
