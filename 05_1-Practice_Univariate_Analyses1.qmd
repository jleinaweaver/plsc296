Prep for Class

1. Pull WDI data and post on Canvas

    - Both the original and the tidy version

2. Check Canvas submissions

<br>

*While students coming in*: Everybody make sure they finished the practice exercises for today AND grab the dataset we'll be using from Canvas.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Lots to do so let's dive in with your practice exercises for today!
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# 1. What is the regional breakdown of UN member states? 
library(carData)

ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +

```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.75, fig.width=6}
# 1. What is the regional breakdown of UN member states? 
library(carData)

ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "mediumpurple")
```

::: notes

Don't forget that accessing this dataset requires installing AND loading carData

<br>

### Everybody get this? (or the rotated version?)

<br>

### What did we learn from this?
- (Who are the NAs? Mostly non-state territories e.g. American Samoa, Guam, etc)

- Africa has a lot of countries!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Time to talk about polishing a visualization for a professional audience
:::



## Visualizations MUST include {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center .smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.asp=1.1, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Figure 1. A count of countries by regional grouping from the United Nations (2009-2011) that shows the great majority of countries in the UN are located in Africa and Asia."}
# The labs() function
library(carData)

ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "x Axis Label", y = "y Axis Label", 
       title = "A title like a thesis statement for the visualization")

# caption = "Source: Where did the data come from?"
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. Informative titles,

2. Clear axis labels, and

3. A figure caption with

    - Data sources
    
    - Description, and
    
    - Conclusions
:::
:::
::::

::: notes

From this point forward, anytime you submit a visualization it must be polished enough that you could present it to a professional audience.

<br>

At a minimum, that means you include:

1. A title or figure caption that explains the key takeaway of the visualization in your argument,
    - Not just a simple description of the plot (that's what the axis labels are for!)

2. Clearly defined axis labels, and

3. A plot caption or figure label that identifies where the data came from

<br>

We can get even fancier, but this represents my minimum expectations from you this semester.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's add each piece one at a time
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# The labs() function
ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "United Nations Regions")
```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.8, fig.width=6}
# The labs() function
ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "United Nations Regions")
```

::: notes

The labs function has a bunch of possible arguments, e.g. labels you can add to your plot

- Here I'm adding x and y axis labels

- Just separate each argument with a comma

<br>

**SLIDE**: Add a caption
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# The labs() function
ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "United Nations Regions", 
       caption = "Source: UNSD (2012)")
```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.8, fig.width=6}
# The labs() function
ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "United Nations Regions", 
       caption = "Source: UNSD (2012)")
```

::: notes

The caption argument adds a small note on the bottom right of the plot
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# The labs() function
ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "United Nations Regions", 
       caption = "Source: UNSD (2012)",
       title = "The UN tracks data for non-member states")
```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.8, fig.width=6}
# The labs() function
ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "United Nations Regions", 
       caption = "Source: UNSD (2012)",
       title = "The UN tracks data for non-member states")
```

::: notes

Finally we add a thesis statement for our visualization

- No simple description titles in here!

- Your title should convey the key takeaway from the visualization for the reader

- The goal is that someone could go through your report only looking at the figures and follow along with your argument!

<br>

### Is everybody clear on my expectation for your polished visualizations?

<br>

### Any questions on using the labs function?

<br>

This represents the absolute baseline for a visualization in this class.

- However, as you add skills I will hopefully see you making your visualizations even more compelling.

- **SLIDE**: For example
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# The labs() function
ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar(fill = c(rep("darkblue", 8), "red")) +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "United Nations Regions", 
       caption = "Source: UNSD (2012)", 
       title = "The UN tracks data for non-member states")
```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.8, fig.width=6}
# The labs() function
ggplot(data = UN, aes(y = region)) +
  geom_bar(fill = c(rep("darkblue", 8), "red")) +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "United Nations Regions", 
       caption = "Source: UNSD (2012)", 
       title = "The UN tracks data for non-member states")
```

::: notes

We should continuously look for ways to draw the reader's eye to the key aspects of the visualization

- Your informative title helps, but there is much more we can do!

- In a paper all about data tracking around the world, making the NA bar stand out helps draw the readers eye to the key point!

<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Practice question number 2, life expectancy in the world
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center .smaller}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**How much variation in life expectancy around the world?**
:::

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = UN, aes(x = lifeExpF)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.8, fig.width=6}
ggplot(data = UN, aes(x = lifeExpF)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = UN, aes(x = lifeExpF)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.8, fig.width=6}
ggplot(data = UN, aes(x = lifeExpF)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
:::
::::

::: notes
**Everybody get these two plots?**

<br>

### Which visualization is a more useful way to present the distribution of life expectancies around the world? Why?

<br>

Let's practice our polishing!

- Everybody add a title, caption and labels to the histogram!

- (**SLIDE**)
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = UN, aes(x = lifeExpF)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Life Expectancy (years)", y = "Count", 
       caption = "Source: UNSD (2012)", 
       title = "One third of states have a life expectancy below 70")
```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.618, fig.width=8}
# Color bars below 70
UN$life_color <- if_else(UN$lifeExpF <= 71, "TRUE", "FALSE")

ggplot(data = UN, aes(x = lifeExpF, fill = life_color)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Life Expectancy (years)", y = "Count", 
       caption = "Source: UNSD (2012)", 
       title = "One third of states have a life expectancy below 70") +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey26", "red3"))

```

::: notes

Coloring bars in a histogram is a little more complicated, but we'll get there.

<br>

### For now, does the aim of polishing a visualization make sense?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last practice exercise - US population since 1790
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = USPop, aes(x = year, y = population)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "", y = "US Population (millions)", 
       caption = "Source: U.S. Census Bureau (2008)", 
       title = "The US has rapidly added population since 1780")
```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.618, fig.width=8}
# 3. Visualize the growth in the US population since 1790
ggplot(data = USPop, aes(x = year, y = population)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "", y = "US Population (millions)", 
       caption = "Source: U.S. Census Bureau (2008)", 
       title = "The US has rapidly added population since 1780")
```

::: notes
**Everybody get this?**

<br>

### Any questions on polishing your plots for a professional audience?

<br>

We'll keep tweaking our plots, but this represents the basics you must include.
:::




## {background-image="Images/06_1-WDI_Front.png"}

::: notes

Today we:

1. Continue practicing our univariate tools, 

2. We pick up some new skills, and 

3. We do it by exploring data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators.

<br>

As you hopefully got from the reading for today, the WDI is a very useful repository of data on countries around the world.

- I've posted the untidy data so you can see what the output from the WDI looks like

- HOWEVER, for our work in R please use the "tidy" version of the dataset

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk about importing Excel data into R
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/05_1-RStudio_Import2.png")
```

::: notes

You can import data purely with code, HOWEVER, in my experience new users have a MUCH easier time using the menus for this.

- These importing data slides are on Canvas in case you forget how to do this.

<br>

Step 1 is to open the import window
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/05_1-RStudio_Import3.png")
```

::: notes

Here you see the excel input window 

- Note that all the choices you make here get written into code in the bottom-right corner.

- Useful for learning the code approach
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/05_1-RStudio_Import3-SP24-Browse.png")
```

::: notes

Step 2: "Browse" to the data you saved on your hard drive

- It should then populate all the fields below with its best guesses
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/05_1-RStudio_Import3-SP24-NAs.png")
```

::: notes

Step 3, use the preview code to make sure R "sees" the data as you expect it to

- VERY IMPORTANT to look at the data in the preview window

<br>

In this example you can see that R thinks all of our numeric variables are actually categorical variables!

- This is because it sees the NAs as words not as missing data!

- In a variable with words and numbers it is forced to treat all of the values as words

<br>

In the NA field put in 'NA' and after you click out of that box you should see the preview refresh to show numeric variables are now "double" which is a type of numeric variable

- **SLIDE**
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/05_1-RStudio_Import4-SP24.png")
```

::: notes

Last step, name the dataset object

- This is what we will type in to access this data in R

<br>

### Make sense? Any questions on importing tidy Excel data using the menu?

- FYI: Code preview shows that importing data in code uses the read_excel() function.
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
View(wdi)
```

```{r}
wdi |>
  slice_head(n = 8) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(digits = 1, align = "c") |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 22) |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:8, background = "white")
```

::: notes

Let's talk through the data I've pulled for you from WDI

- All countries in the WDI from 2003 to 2021

- `wb_income` categorizes all states by their income level using the World Bank thresholds from 2021 (low, lower-middle, upper-middle and high)

- `gdp_per_capita` is gross domestic product divided by population

- `measles_herd_immunity` is a categorization of states as to whether they've achieved herd immunity in measles (e.g. 95%).

- `measles_immunizations_pct` is the actual percent of under 2s immunized against measles

- `birth_rate` is the number of births per 1,000 people

- `death_rate` is the number of deaths per 1,000 people

<br>

### Any questions on the data?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Filter to current year
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Extract some observations from the dataset
wdi2021 <- filter(wdi, year == 2021)

View(wdi2021)
```

```{r}
wdi2021 <- filter(wdi, year == 2021)

wdi2021 |>
  slice_head(n = 7) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(digits = 1, align = "c") |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 22) |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:8, background = "white")
```

::: notes

While I've given you data across time, I'd like us to work today focused on only the most recent year with complete data in the WDI: 2021.

<br>

Everybody create a new object called "data2021" and use the filter function to extract only those rows in our dataset from the year 2021

- The filter function requires the dataset and then the conditions you are interested in

- Remember the double equals sign means "equals to"

<br>

### Everybody got that?
:::


## Filter() is Very Useful {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Filter for one variable
filter(wdi, wb_income == "Low")
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Filter by relative values
filter(wdi, death_rate > 20)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Filter by two variables
filter(wdi, country == "Ireland", year == 2008)
```

:::::

::: notes

Filter is an INCREDIBLY useful function

- You can use it to filter a dataset by ANY variable or multiple variables

**Univariate Analyses of Global Child Protection in 2021**

<br>

1. Visualize: How many countries have reached herd immunity for measles?

2. Visualize: What is the distribution of countries by the percent of 2 year olds immunized against measles?

3. Calculate: What are the descriptive statistics that describe the proportion of 2 year olds immunized against measles?

::: notes

Focus only on 2021 as our most recent complete year of data

<br>

As noted, I have given you two measures of measles vaccinations in children around the world.

- `measles_immunizations_pct` is the percent of under 2s are immunized against measles

- `measles_herd_immunity` is a categorization of states as to whether they've achieved herd immunity (e.g. 95%).

<br>

I would like you to analyze those two variables in these three ways so we can learn something about childhood disease prevention in 2021.

- Make sure to polish your visualizations!

- Go!

<br>

### Ok, what do we learn from this visualization?

- *Force this discussion*

- (Big risk in the world)

- (Might be a serious missing data problem!)

<br>

**SLIDE**: the missing data problem

## The Missing Data Problem {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=1, fig.width=5}

::: notes

A constant challenge for you as a data researchers is deciding what to do about missing data.

### Do these two plots tell a different story? How?

- *Force this discussion*

<br>

### When do we use the left plot and when the right plot in a report?

- *Force this discussion*

<br>

First key lesson: Don't hide your missing data unless you are sure it doesn't create a selection bias problem for your analysis.

- That means you have to believe these countries are missing more or less at random

- If all the missing countries look alike (e.g. poor states) then removing them misrepresents the story

<br>

Almost 25 countries missing data here (approx 12%)

- My guess is that these countries undoubtedly look alike (e.g. lacking infrastructure)

- In other words, my guess is the risk bar should be much higher...

<br>

For now I'm not going to give you the code to remove the missing data.

- Let's work with our data as it exists and then decide what to do about it.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Histogram time!
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

::::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Histogram
ggplot(data = wdi2021, aes(x = measles_immunizations_pct)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "slateblue3") +
  labs(x = "Measles Immunizations (%)", y = "Count",
       caption = "Source: WDI (2021)",
       title = "??")
```
:::::

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.618, fig.width=8}
# Histogram

  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "slateblue3") +
  labs(x = "Measles Immunizations (%)", y = "Count",
       caption = "Source: WDI (2021)",
       title = "??")
```

::: notes

I tweaked the number of bins here to smooth out the distribution a bit.

- Histogram bins is often a matter of taste rather than hard and fast rule (although many "rules" are out there)

- Choose bins to help the reader see the distribution WITHOUT distorting it

<br>

**What title does this need?**

- **What is a key conclusion you want the reader to draw from this?**

<br>

- (25% of countries are woefully unprepared for a measles outbreak (<75%))

::: notes

Alright, let's talk about what we've made.

<br>

**Which of these approaches tells the clearest story about global measles vaccinations in 2019?**

- (Bar Plot: Cleanest story if message is more than half the world is at risk)

- (Histogram: Nicely helps us unpack the extensive variation in the "at risk" population)

- (Descriptives: Super handy for writing this up, e.g. the average is X, the minimum and maximum are...)

<br>

**Does everybody see how these three tools give us a WAY better grasp of the data than just looking at the spreadsheet?**

<br>

THIS is the power of univariate analyses!

- I can't emphasize this enough, these simple tools add SO, SO much to a written argument.

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

**What is the state of global development in 2021?**

- measles_herd_immunity
- measles_immunizations_pct
- WB Income
- gdp_per_capita
- birth_rate
- death_rate

::: notes

For next class I want you to expand our work in order to answer this broader question

- As a snapshot of the world in 2021, how are we doing in terms of economic and human development?

<br>

I'd like you to attack this in two ways and these details are on Canvas

<br>

FIRST, produce a polished visualization for each of these six variables in our WDI dataset for 2021

- Good news is the first two are already done they just might need some final polishing

<br>
