Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

## {background-image="Images/06_1-WDI_Front.png"}

::: notes

Last class, we began exploring data from the World Bank's WDI database.

- A very useful repository of national statistics from something around 217 "economies" around the world.

<br>

Today we'll start by reviewing your practice exercises, and then use our tools to expand our analyses across time

<br>

**SLIDE**: Quick aside...

```

::: notes

My hope is that as we work with data and grapple with the importance of uncertainty for our knowledge you will begin to see just how AWFUL many visualizations are.

<br>

### Why is this an abomination of data?

<br>

This visualization gives me nightmares

- Don't use 3-d if the 3-d provides ZERO new information

- Make the axis scales logical!

- I don't think these are continents...

- Where does this data come from?

- What do these bars actually show?

- Why are there drop shadows?!?!?

<br>

### Is everybody clear on this is an abomination?

## Polishing your Visualizations {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

1. Include an informative title

2. Add a figure label and caption

3. Identify the source(s)

4. Ensure the axis labels are clear and readable

5. Maximize the data-to-ink ratio

::: notes
As we began to discuss last class, I expect you to produce high quality data visualizations

- This means producing visualizations that would look good in any presentation, report, book, web post, poster, etc.

<br>

1. Include an informative title
    - EVERY visualization should have a title that tells the viewer the main point of the analysis
    - Don't force them to guess or to struggle to decipher the point, just tell them.

2. Add a label to the figure (with a figure number)
    - e.g. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3
    - Otherwise it's impossible to refer to it in the text
    - Plus a caption to explain what is being shown in the visualization

3. Identify the source(s)
    - Somewhere on the Figure or in the label you MUST make clear where the data came from

4. Ensure the axis labels are clear and readable

5. Maximize the data-to-ink ratio
    - As much as possible, the "ink" should be tied directly to data
    - e.g. No extra 3-d nonsense!
    - e.g. No big empty spaces
    - e.g. No chart junk!

<br>

### Questions on these?
:::




## For Today {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**What is the state of global development in 2021?**

- WB Income
- gdp_per_capita
- measles_herd_immunity
- measles_immunizations_pct
- birth_rate
- death_rate

::: notes
**Ok, how did your assignment for today go?**

- **Any trouble copying images into Canvas? Or polishing the visualizations?**
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(data2021$gdp_per_capita)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(data2021$measles_immunizations_pct)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(data2021$birth_rate)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(data2021$death_rate)
```

::: notes

Taking all of this on board, where do we end up?

**Based on this data and these analyses, what would you argue is the current state of global development?**

- *Encourage this discussion*

::: notes
**What do we learn from comparing and contrasting these two methods for measuring the wealth of a country?**

<br>

**Which is the more "accurate" takeaway? Is most of the world "rich" or "poor"?**

<br>

What I hope is clear from this is that while a univariate visualization is useful for describing variation, it is VERY limited for helping us understand what that variation means on the ground

- One option is to include external benchmarks (like these) or alternative ways of measuring the same problem

- The handy thing here is that this just requires you to pair two visualizations together, no new code required!

<br>

#### Notes

WB categories
- Low: up to 1,045
- Low-mid: up to 4,095
- Upper-mid: up to 12,695

Another option might be to flag where in a given distribution example countries might appear.

- For an American audience I can imagine this helping us think about the world relative to our own experiences.

<br>

### Other than just the host country, any other things you think we could flag on these plots to help the reader understand them better?

  annotate("segment", x = 67000, y = 35, xend = 67000, yend = 13, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

Here is the code you need to:

1. Add text to any plot, AND

2. Add an arrow

<br>

*Walk them through the code arguments for each*

<br>

Test it out.

- Try adding random text somewhere on the plot, and

- an arrow

**Analysis Option 3: Snapshots Across Time**

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.618, fig.width=7}
# Subset the data by one year
data1985 <- filter(data1, year == 1985)

ggplot(data1985, aes(x = measles_immunizations_pct)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = "blue", color = "white")
```

::: notes

The third way we can add context to our analyses is with across time data

- Can we compare observations to themselves at different points in time?

<br>

The WDI dataset I provided you has country-year data going back to 1985

- So let's use that data to see how measles vaccinations have changed over time!

<br>

**Why does having both of these visualizations make our analyses so much more useful?**

- (Allows us to track a distribution across time)

- (The world has made incredible progress in fighting measles but there is much left to do!)

# Histogram across time
ggplot(data1, aes(x = measles_immunizations_pct)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  transition_time(year) +

The key here is the "transition_time" function

- THAT's the piece that creates the animation as a gif
