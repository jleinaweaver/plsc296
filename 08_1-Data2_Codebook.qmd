Prep for Class

1. Update slides BEFORE class
    - Insert research question agreed upon last class and update DAG
    - Add measures to evaluate

2. Bring markers for every group (x6 in SP24)

3. Make sure the codebook and dataset are on Canvas
    - [CoW NMC website](https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/national-material-capabilities/)

## Research Question? {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height=2}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Military\nPower\n(CoW NMC)", "Human rights\nand\nthe rule of law\n(FFP)")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.85, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes
Research question brainstorming from Canvas forum

- How does militarization influence states' violation of human rights?

- Do states with more military power have more human rights violations?

- How do defense capabilities impact the quality of human rights in a country?

- Does a state's military capacity impact the likelihood of human rights violations?

<br>

Your Brainstorming

- Do states that prioritize their military capabilities respect human rights and the rule of law?

- Do more powerful states tend to undermine the human rights of their citizens?

## Report 2 {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png"}

<br>

**Analyzing our Predictor Variable(s)**

<br>

1. Why is this project important?

2. How confident should we be in the methodology?

3. What do the measures currently show us?

4. How are these measures changing across time?

::: notes
This week we work on your second report

- This will be due at the end of spring break (March 17th), and 

- In terms of structure and expectations it mirrors the work you did for the first report

<br>

Our plan this week

- Today focus on Section 2 by analyzing the codebook 

- Wednesday we work on Section 1 and audit the dataset

- Friday we work on Sections 3 and 4

## National Material Capabilities (CoW) {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

**Six Indicators Used to Produce the CINC**

1. Military Expenditures, thousands of dollars (`milex`)

2. Military Personnel, thousands (`milper`)

3. Iron and steel production, thousands of tons (`irst`)

4. Primary Energy Consumption, metric ton coal equivalent (`pec`)

5. Total Population, thousands (`tpop`)

6. Urban population, pop living in cities +100,000 in thousands (`upop`)

::: notes
As you read for today, the Correlates of War's National Material Capabilities dataset is a project aimed at measuring state power across time

- Version 6 of the dataset covers 1816-2016

<br>

These six indicators are processed and averaged in order to produce a CINC score for every country in every year of the dataset

- The CINC is the "Composite Index of National Capability"

<br>

In broad strokes, the cinc for a single country-year is produced by:

1. Converting the value of each indicator into a proportion of the global total, and

2. Calculating the average proportion across the six indicators

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's make sure everybody has this intuition down before we get to analyzing the codebook

First step, sum each variable across all countries for the year 1816

<br>

On the slide:

- LEFT: The top six iron and steel producing countries in 1816

- RIGHT: The sum of all iron and steel production in 1816

<br>

**So, what proportion of global iron and steel production did the US represent in 1816?**

**The Average Proportion (e.g. the CINC) = 3.97%**
:::

::: notes
Here's the data on the US and the world in 1816 across all six indicators

- *Walk through the table*

<br>

**Does calculating the CINC make sense in an intuitive sense?**

<br>

**So, how many sources of uncertainty are there in every country-year cinc score?**

<br>

Sources of Uncertainty

- Are these the right six indicators?

- How confident are we in the value of each indicator and each year?

- Since we're talking "proportion of the global total," are we confident this sample of countries represents the global total? 

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today I'd like us to focus our analysis of the codebook on the indicators themselves.

**Analyze the Methodology**

- Source of the Data

- Operationalization

- Instrumentation

- Measurement Process

- Data Validation
:::
::::

::: notes
In order to analyze the CINC, we need to first analyze the indicators as measures

- So, I've paired you off and assigned each pair to a single indicator

<br>

Pairs, your job is to make two lists on the board

- What are the strengths and weaknesses of this indicator's methodology?

<br>

### Any questions?

- Please work directly on the board as the whole class will need your notes to help them write Section 2!

- Get to work!

<br>

*PRESENT each*

- Everybody write down all the work on the board! 

- The pros and cons for each indicator IS the material you need to make an argument about the usefulness of the overall CINC score!

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

<br>

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/08_1-ASSIGNMENT.png")
```

::: notes
- Audit the Dataset: Make sure you understand how the data is organized (observations and variables), and have spent time auditing it for missing data (time or region)

- Explore the Dataset: Submit THREE interesting, puzzling or surprising things about the world of this dataset. Fully explain each of your findings and how you can support your claims using the data.

<br>

**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:** Missing data in the NMC is coded as -9 so you HAVE to put that in the na field when you import the data!
