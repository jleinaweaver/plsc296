## Practice for Today {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

1. `cut` and `clarity`

2. `cut` and `price`

3. `carat` and `price` (convert `carat` to a categorical variable)

4. `carat` and `price` (correlation)

**Source:** `diamonds` dataset in tidyverse

::: notes
**Did everybody complete all four of these exercises?**

<br>

**SLIDE:** Let's talk takeaways! (try to move through these quickly)

### Prompt

<br>

<br>

#### **What are your takeaways from analyzing the relationship between the cut and clarity of diamonds?**


### Polished

```{r}
proportions(table(diamonds$clarity, diamonds$cut), margin = 1) |>
  round(digits = 2) |>
  kbl(align = "c") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed"), font_size = 35) |>
  column_spec(2, color = "white", background = c("#C6DBEF", rep("lightgrey", 7))) |>
  column_spec(3, color = "white", background = c(rep("lightgrey", 8))) |>
  column_spec(4, color = "white", background = c(rep("lightgrey", 8))) |>
  column_spec(5, color = "white", background = c("lightgrey", "#BDD7E7", rep("lightgrey", 6))) |>
  column_spec(6, color = "white", background = c(rep("lightgrey", 2), "#BDD7E7", rep("#6BAED6", 2), rep("#3182BD", 2), "#08519C")) |>
  row_spec(0, background = "white") |>
  column_spec(1, background = "white")
```

### Code

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
## Analyzing the relationship between a categorical variable (clarity) 
# and a second categorical variable (cut)

proportions(table(diamonds$clarity, diamonds$cut))

proportions(table(diamonds$clarity, diamonds$cut), margin = 1)

proportions(table(diamonds$clarity, diamonds$cut), margin = 2)
```

:::

::: notes

**Takeaways from analyzing this relationship?**

<br>

POLISHED: Assuming jewelers can control cut, but not clarity I think this version of the table makes the most sense (e.g. row margins)

- Here I've highlighted the highest proportion in each row AND increased the heat of the color as the proportions increase


<br>

My takeaway:

- I assume the clarity is more out of the jewelers control

- When jewelers have an internally flawless diamond (IF) or close to it, they clearly try to give it their highest quality cut (maximize price)

- At the opposite end, when you see a "fair" cut diamond it is safe to assume it is not very clear at all.

Your next job was to analyze the relationship between the price and cut quality of the diamonds.

**What did you find?**

<br>

**Why the big differences between mean and medians?**

<br>

**What specifically can we infer based on the fact that the ranges overlap so much?**

- (More factors to diamond price! Especially the size of the diamond!)

<br>

<br>

#### **What are your takeaways from analyzing the relationship between the size and the price of diamonds?**


### Option: Conversion

<br>

:::: {.r-fit-text}
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Option 1: Transform a numeric variable (carat) into a categorical variable
diamonds$carat2 <- cut(diamonds$carat, 
                       breaks = c(0, .4, .7, 1.04, 5.5), 
                       labels = c("1st Q", "2nd Q", "3rd Q", "4th Q"))

# Describe the new relationship
aggregate(data = diamonds, price ~ carat2, FUN = summary)
```
::::


### Option: Correlation

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Correlation
cor(diamonds$carat, diamonds$price)
```

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Statistical Test
cor.test(diamonds$carat, diamonds$price)
```

:::

::: notes
Your next job was to analyze the relationship between the price and weight of the diamonds.

- **What did you find?**

- (Pretty clear that diamond size is a BIG determinant of price!)

- (A STRONG linear relationship implied by this VERY high correlation score)

<br>

This is another approach that would REALLY benefit from visualization!

<br>

**Any questions on the practice exercises or the tools/concepts from last class?**

## Bivariate Analyses {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Descriptive Statistics by Group
    - Counts, Proportions, Means, Medians, Standard Deviations, Percentiles, Ranges, Interquartile Ranges (IQR) and Correlations

2. Visualizations
    - Bar plots (stacked, side-by-side, proportions), facet wraps, density plots, box plots and scatter plots

::: notes

On Monday, we worked on the Descriptive Statistics by Group.

- Essentially you can calculate all of these using the table, summary and aggregate functions

<br>

Today we dive into bivariate visualizations as a tool for analyzing a relationship.

- The descriptive statistics help us discuss our analyses in text, but the pictures enable the reader to MUCH better understand what the world looks like.
:::



## 3. Variable type determines the tool {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_2-levels_measurement.png")
```

::: notes
Just as we did previously, we will be guided in learning our new tools by this rule of data science!

- If you know the variable types you are analyzing, choosing the right tool is done for you!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start with a univariate analysis of a single categorical variable
:::




## Categorical x Categorical {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.asp=.9, cache=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.asp=.9, cache=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv)) +
  geom_bar()
```
:::
::::

::: notes

Ah yes, our old friend the bar plot!

- On the left is the distribution of cars by "class"

- On the right is the distribution of drive trains

<br>

Previously we used stacked bar plots to examine changes in the trend of a categorical variable across time

- What I want to show you now is that a stacked bar plot works for visualizing the relationship between any two categorical variables

<br>

**SLIDE**: The first type of bivariate bar plot is what we call a side-by-side plot

:::


## Categorical x Categorical {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.asp=.6, cache=FALSE}
# Side-by-side bar plots
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

::: notes

*Make sure they can interpret these results*

- For the bivariate case geom_bar needs an x and a fill argument inside the aes function.

<br>

By default geom_bar adjusts the width of the bars so each x label takes up the same space.

- I really don't love this default choice.

- **SLIDE**: Let's fix it.
:::



## Categorical x Categorical {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.asp=.6, cache=FALSE}
# Side-by-side bar plots
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single"))
```

::: notes

**What do we learn from this? What does the relationship appear to be between class and drive train?**

<br>

Practice for me

- I want you to get a sense of what happens when you change which variable goes on the x axis and which is the fill.

- Swap the 'x' and 'fill' variables in this code

<br>

**SLIDE**: Result

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  labs(title = "x = class, fill = drv") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 2)
```

::: notes
**What question does this plot on the right help us answer? How is it different from the other one?**

- (What types of car class are most associated with each type of drive train)

<br>

Same data, same tool, very different questions answered!

<br>

**Questions on making a side-by-side bar plot two categorical variables?**
:::



## Categorical x Categorical {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.asp=.75, cache=FALSE}
# Stacked bar plots
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack")
```

::: notes
Here we see the second style of bivariate bar plot: A Stacked Bar Plot

<br>

**Why is the stacked bar plot better for analyzing this relationship?**

- (These plots are meant to tell us how each class of car uses the various drive trains and stacked bars help you see the proportions specific to each car)

<br>

**Make sense?**
:::


## Categorical x Categorical {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.asp=.618, cache=FALSE}
# Proportionate bar plot
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

::: notes
Last style of common bar plot is a proportional stacked bar plot.

- Super cool approach transforms each bar to a proportion of 100% per x variable level.

- So, the y-axis marks off the proportion of the total represented by each level of the fill variable.

<br>

Clearly makes comparisons and summary easier, BUT...

<br>

**Why are these super dangerous?**

- Look on the left plot, very FEW 2seaters and minivans so the proportions are much less stable

- Only takes adding one of this class with a different drive train to dramatically change the %'s

<br>

**Any questions on our three versions of the bar plot?**

- Remember, need to specify both an 'x' and a 'fill' variable PLUS a 'position' argument in the geom_bar

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's tweak the y-axis labels to match the proportions

:::



## Categorical x Categorical {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.asp=.618, cache=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(x = "", y = "")
```

::: notes
The y-axis is converted to proportions so we can tweak the labels along the tick marks

<br>

**Make sense?**

::: notes
Next visualization challenge!

<br>

We have a numeric variable, city fuel economy, and a categorical variable, car drive trains.

- Last class we calculated summary statistics of the numeric variable for each level of the categorical variable using the aggregate function

- Today I'll show you three options for visualizing this relationship

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our first option is simply to make separate histograms for each drive train
:::



## Categorical x Numeric Variable {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center .smaller}

**1. Facet Wrap**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ drv)
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=1.2, cache=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ drv, ncol = 1)
```
:::
::::

::: notes
Option 1: facet_wrap

- Use a tilde and then the categorical variable

- This produces separate histograms for each level of the categorical variable

<br>

On the right I used the "ncol" argument to specify you want a single column of plots

- Much easier to compare across the distributions this way

<br>

**What does this suggest about the relationship between fuel economy and car drive trains?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's try a new approach, overlapping density plots
:::



## Categorical x Numeric Variable {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="35%"}

<br>

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.75}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "City Fuel Economy (mpg)", 
       y = "Count")
```
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618}
# 2. Density Plots
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw()  +
  labs(x = "City Fuel Economy (mpg)", 
       y = "Density")
```
:::
::::

::: notes
Think of a density plot like a smoothed histogram

- Histograms count observations in bins

- Density plots represent the relative probability of values

- The higher the point on the curve, the more likely the observations near that value of the variable

<br>

**Does everybody see how these two plots represent the same idea in different ways?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Density plots make it much easier to overlay distributions
:::



## Categorical x Numeric Variable {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.618}
# 2. Density Plots
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, fill = drv)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .4) +
  theme_bw()
```

::: notes
Much clearer if only two levels of the categorical variable OR if the distributions are separated widely

- However, a useful tool to add to your toolbox.

<br>

**Questions on this second option for visualizing the relationship between a numeric and a categorical variable?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Facet wraps and density plots can help you see the whole distribution-ish, but this is a problem box plots were designed to solve!
:::



## Categorical x Numeric Variable {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v4.png" .center}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# 3. Box Plot
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = drv)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.asp=.9, cache=FALSE}
# Box Plot
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = drv)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = c("r", "f", "4"))
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.asp=1.2, cache=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, `code-line-numbers`="1,3") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ drv, ncol = 1)
```
:::
::::

::: notes
Here is where we see the real utility of box plots.

- For comparing the distribution of numeric variables across the levels of a categorical variable.

<br>

**Remind me, what are the main components of a box plot?**

- (Median is the black line)
- (IQR is the box)
- (Whiskers extend 1.5x the IQR)
- (Outliers identified)

<br>

**Does everybody see how both of these visualizations represent the same data?**

<br>

**When would you prefer to use the boxes and when the histograms?**

- **What are the benefits of each approach?**
