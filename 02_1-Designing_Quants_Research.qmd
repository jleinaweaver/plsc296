This week we work to set up our research project for the semester

- To do this we first have to touch base on the big ideas of research design and research questions.

<br>

But first, a quick refresher on last week!

- Last week we tried to measure a bunch of things in order to learn something about the world

- **What were your takeaways from our work last week?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## Science as Measurement {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. Science means answering questions with data

2. Data is generated by measuring the empirical world

3. All measurements include uncertainty

4. So, all answers include uncertainty
:::

::: notes

Remember, the goal of science is to answer important questions 

- And the answers to those questions are only valuable IF the UNCERTAINTY is explained clearly

<br>

I'm not claiming we now KNOW for certain the population of the US, the number of countries in the world, or the number of current wars

- I AM CLAIMING you now have a MUCH better understanding of those "facts" than you did before

<br>

**Everybody clear on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: This takes us to the importance of research design

:::




## Huntington-Klein (2022) Chapter 1 {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v3.png" .center}

<br>

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**What is "research"?**
:::

::: notes

Let's talk big picture about research and research design using the reading.

<br>

**Per Section 1.1, what is the purpose of "well-designed" research?**

- ("Well-designed research is research capable of answering the question it’s trying to answer.")

<br>

**Per 1.2, what makes research "empirical"?**

- ("Empirical research is any research that uses structured observations from the real world to attempt to answer questions.")

- ("Quantitative empirical research is just empirical research that uses quantitative measurements (numbers, usually).")

<br>

**Per 1.3, why does research need a "design"?**

- (**SLIDE**: There are two big and connected reasons)

:::



## Research design is hard... {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"...just because you want to answer a question doesn’t mean there’s necessarily a straightforward way of doing it."

<br>

::: {.fragment}

**What would it ACTUALLY take to answer this question?**

- Worst Case Scenario: You won't produce crappy research

- Best Case Scenario: You have a plan to answer a question

:::

::: notes

The FIRST reason anybody who wants to answer a question needs a research design is because the design is your chance to figure out what it would take to actually answer the question.

- Once you do this you will understand the challenge at a much deeper level AND it will give you the tools to evaluate OTHER peoples' answers to the question

- e.g. Did they do the work needed to be that confident about their answer? If not...

<br>

We are constantly surrounded by people asserting answers to questions based on data that doesn't actually do the job they are claiming.

- Sometimes they are actively trying to mislead you and sometimes they simply don't know how to do it better

<br>

Learning to be careful researchers means learning HOW to answer questions

- **REVEAL**: Your research design is you explaining to others HOW you will answer the question

<br>

This means that evaluating someone's research design is MUCH MORE IMPORTANT than their fancy statistics and data visualizations

- **THIS IS A KEY LESSON FOR THE SEMESTER!**

- There are tons of "answers" out there, my job is to help you develop the tools to interpret the usefulness of those answers.

<br>

**Any questions on the first chapter of the Huntington-Klein book?**

- As I said, very much setting the table for the work to come.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Now we talk research questions...

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Why do we need a research question?**

:::: {.incremental}

<br>

A research question...

- **focuses** your work,

- **drives** your progress, and

- let's you know when you're **done**.

:::
::::

::: notes

The second chapter for today is all about helping us see the difference between questions and GOOD RESEARCH questions.

- **According to HK, why do we need a research question?**

1. Exploring data without a question can help you find patterns but not help you to understand why things happen
    - e.g. data mining

2. Without a disciplined research question, there’s no reason not to just check everything! 
    - Something is going to pop up as related by random chance if you check enough stuff.

<br>

Drawing from the Baglione book we use in Political Inquiry highlights some other useful answers to this question...

<br>

**REVEAL**: FIRST, "Topics are too broad" and contain many, many possible issues

- Questions focus you on what is manageable 

<br>

**REVEAL**: SECOND, questions link you to controversies, controversies lead you to academic literature

<br>

**REVEAL**: FINALLY, questions demand an answer and the need for an answer helps you move forward and track how far you've gone

<br>

I especially like Baglione's idea here that a good research question gives us a progress bar for our research.

- Along the way we simply ask ourselves, have we answered the question or not?

- And, is my answer convincing or not?

<br>

### According to HK, what is the first key element that distinguishes a "question" from a "research question"?

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Research Questions (Huntington-Klein 2022)**

1. Can be answered

:::

::: notes

It means that it’s possible for there to be some set of evidence in the world that, if you found it, your question would have a believable answer. 

<br>

The book chapter gives us an example: what is the best James Bond movie?

- **Why can't that question be answered?**

<br>

**What if we collected survey data asking people to rank their favorite Bond movies in order? Wouldn't that do it?**

- (That's a measure of "popularity" not "quality"!)

<br>

**Give me some examples of other questions that cannot be answered with empirical data.**

<br>

**Questions on the first criteria?**

<br>

**What is the second key element that distinguishes a "question" from a "research question"?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Research Questions (Huntington-Klein 2022)**

1. Can be answered

2. Improves our understanding of the world

:::

::: notes

A good research question leads to an answer that will improve your understanding of how the world works.

- It should inform theory in some way.

<br>

**Alright then, per HK, what is "theory"?**

- (Theory just means that there’s a *why* underpinning your view of the world)

- Theory explains why we think the relationships we see in the world are happening 

- Theory is the simplified story we tell to explain why thing's happen

<br>

You almost certainly have a million intuitions about how and why the world works like it does.

- Our aim is to design research projects that force us to clarify these assumptions in order to test them with empirical data.

- A good research question helps us begin that process

<br>

**SLIDE**: The second criteria reinforced...

## {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Research Questions (Huntington-Klein 2022)**

1. Can be answered

2. Improves our understanding of the world

:::

<br>

"A good test for whether a research question informs theory is to imagine that you find an unexpected result, and then wonder whether it would make you change your understanding of the world."

::: notes

I especially like this advice from Huntington-Klein on the second criteria.

- A good RQ should have stakes!

- If getting an answer you didn't expect forces you to rethink how the world works, that's a good question!

<br>

**Any questions on these two basic requirements of a research question?**

<br>

So, all academic projects in quantitative political science are framed as an answer to a research question.

- The question itself MUST be answerable with data and the answer must help us better understand the world (support or lead to revision of a theory).

<br>

**SLIDE**: HK also offers us criteria for analyzing a RQ
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Research Questions (Huntington-Klein 2022)**
:::

<br>

**How Do You Know if You’ve Got a Good One?**

- Consider Potential Results

- Consider Feasibility

- Consider Scale

- Consider Design

- Keep It Simple!


::: notes

Walk me through each of these. 

- **What does each criteria mean and how do I use it to make my research question "better"?**

<br>

- **Consider Potential Results**: "If you can’t say something interesting about your potential results, that probably means your research question and your theory aren’t as closely linked as you think!"

- **Consider Feasibility**: "A research question should be a question that can be answered using the right data, if the right data is available. But is the right data available?"
    - You picked the data project first so this should be done!

- **Consider Scale**: "What kind of resources and time can you dedicate to answering the research question? ... Given the confines of, say, a term paper, you could take some wild swings at that question, but you’re likely to do a much more thorough job answering questions with a lot less complexity."

- **Consider Design**: "So, an important part of evaluating whether you have a workable research question is figuring out if there’s a reasonable research design you can use to answer it. Figuring out whether you do have a reasonable research design is the topic of the rest of this book."

- **Keep It Simple!**: "Answering any research question can be difficult. Don’t make it even harder on yourself by biting off more than you can chew!"

<br>

**Any questions on these criteria? **

```

::: notes

On our Canvas Modules page is a link to a Google Sheet I've made that includes 50+ data projects with interesting topics and accessible datasets.

<br>

Our big job this semester is to build a research project using these sources

- In terms of that goal, Our first task is to pick one of these data projects as our key outcome to explain.

- e.g. the dependent variable for our class research project.

<br>

**Has everybody been able to access the link?**

- **Any questions on the set-up of the sheet?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's use these data options to brainstorm some research questions!

:::



## Propose a Research Question {background-image="Images/background-data_blue_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.fragment}

Your question must:

1. Be answerable,

2. Have an answer that would improve our understanding of the world

3. Be informed by the HK criteria (e.g. considers potential results, feasibility, scale and design)
:::

::: notes

Everybody take some time (5 mins?) to focus in on one of the data projects listed on the Google Sheet.

- Pick a project that you find interesting

- Then brainstorm a research question that might be answerable by that project

- **REVEAL**: Remember our criteria for a "good" research question

<br>

**Any questions on your assignment?**

- Force yourself to write this down on paper, not electronically. 

- Writing by hand represents a different style of thinking and we want to track the revisions you make during class today.

- Go!

<br>

PAIR UP! 

- Share your questions and give each other feedback

    - Is their question answerable? 
    
    - How would it improve our understanding of the world? 
    
    - Can you make their question clearer, more feasible or simpler?

<br>

PRESENT and DISCUSS each

- Is the question answerable? 
    
- How would it improve our understanding of the world? 
    
- Can you make their question clearer, more feasible or simpler?

**For Next Class: Find an Interesting Outcome to Explain**
:::

<br>

Pick **ONE** variable from **ONE** dataset that you think would be a good outcome to explain in our class research project.

- Specify the dataset, the concept, and the specific variable(s)

- Why would this make an interesting outcome to explain?

::: notes

No overlap! 

- Let's build a list of different options to review

<br>

Take some time to actually visit the web page for the data project you select and build your argument for choosing this project based on the details of what you learned there. 

- Take us deeper into why you believe this project is a good source of variation for us and cite details from the project itself. 

- Tell us something cool about the specific measurements that sell us on why we should pick this project!"

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

- Excellent! Get to it!
