Prep for Class

1.  Data spreadsheet should already be on Canvas

<br>

**ANNOUNCEMENTS**

I'm making tweaks to our course plan for the next two weeks.

1. Wed will now be a R&R day
    - Some excellent work I want you all to see from your classmates for inspiration
    
2. Fri we build a class presentation using all the work from your reports

3. Next week we shift to new data project and that pushes the deadline for Report 2 out to the end of spring break

<br>

### Any questions?

**A "Good" Quantitative Research Project Requires a "Good" Measure of the Outcome**

<br>

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height=1.7}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Predictor", "State\nFragility")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.85, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow())
```

So far in this class we've selected the key variation we will try to explain

<br>

### What have we learned about state fragility from the Fragile States Index developed by the Fund for Peace?

### - What key elements made it into your reports?

- *Class leads discussion*

<br>

Our job for today is to select a predictor or set of related predictors that we will use to explain this outcome.

- These two pieces together will lead to our new and revised research question.

<br>

### What did we learn about research questions in week 2?

### - What do they have to do and how do we know if we have a good one?

## Research Questions {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png"}

<br>

**A research question:**

1. Can be answered, and

2. Improves our understanding of how the world works.

<br>

(Huntington-Klein 2022)

::: notes

A good research question leads to an answer that will improve your understanding of how the world works.

<br>

In other words, it should inform theory in some way.
- Theory just means that there’s a *why* or a *because* lurking around somewhere.

- Theory explains why the relationships we see in the world are happening 

<br>

So, all academic projects in quantitative political science are framed as an answer to a research question.

- The question itself MUST be answerable with data and the answer must help us better understand the world (support or lead to revision of a theory).

<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

**SLIDE**: In week 2 we also discussed the criteria for a "good" research question

(Huntington-Klein 2022)

::: notes

**Questions on these criteria?**

<br>

- **Consider Potential Results**: "If you can’t say something interesting about your potential results, that probably means your research question and your theory aren’t as closely linked as you think!"

- **Consider Feasibility**: "A research question should be a question that can be answered using the right data, if the right data is available. But is the right data available?"
    - You picked the data project first so this should be done!

- **Consider Scale**: "What kind of resources and time can you dedicate to answering the research question? ... Given the confines of, say, a term paper, you could take some wild swings at that question, but you’re likely to do a much more thorough job answering questions with a lot less complexity."

- **Consider Design**: "So, an important part of evaluating whether you have a workable research question is figuring out if there’s a reasonable research design you can use to answer it. Figuring out whether you do have a reasonable research design is the topic of the rest of this book."

- **Keep It Simple!**: "Answering any research question can be difficult. Don’t make it even harder on yourself by biting off more than you can chew!"

Ok, this is our aim, so...

<br>

Let's dig into the available data spreadsheet to choose our predictor(s) and refine our research question!

- Everybody take a few minutes on their own to choose a data project and refine our research question and then we'll share ideas.

<br>
